<div class="sidenote">The loue of the people.</div>

<p>This noble prince deceassed at his palace of Westminster, and with great funerall
honor and heauinesse of his people from thence conueied, was interred at Windsor. A
king of such gouernance &amp; behauior, in time of peace (for in warre each part must
n&eacute;eds be others enimie) that there was neuer anie prince of this land, atteining the
crowne by battell, so heartilie beloued with the substance of the people: nor h&eacute;e
himselfe so speciallie in anie part of his life, as at the time of his death. Which
fauour and affection, yet after his deceasse, by the crueltie, mischiefe, and trouble of
the tempestuous world that followed, highlie toward him more increased. At such
time as he died, the displeasure of those that bare him grudge for king Henrie's sake
the sixt, whome he deposed, was well asswaged, &amp; in effect quenched, in that manie
of them were dead in more than twentie yeres of his reigne, a great part of a long life:
and manie of them in the meane season growne into his fauour, of which he was
neuer strange.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Description of Edward the fourth.</div>

<p>He was a goodlie personage, and princelie to behold, of heart couragious, politike
in counsell, in aduersitie nothing abashed, in prosperitie rather ioifull than proud,
peace iust and mercifull, in warre sharpe and fierce, in the field bold and hardie, and
nathelesse no further (than wisedome would) aduenturous, whose warres who so well
considered, he shall no lesse commend his wisedome where he voided, than his manhood
where he vanquished. He was of visage louelie, of bodie mightie, strong, and
cleane made: howbeit, in his latter daies with ouer liberall diet somewhat corpulent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>and boorelie, and nathelesse not vncomelie. He was of youth greatlie giuen to fleshlie
wantonnesse: from which health of bodie, in great prosperitie and fortune, without a
speciall grace hardlie refraineth, the poet implieng no lesse and saieng:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mens erit apta capi tunc c&ugrave;m l&aelig;tissima rerum.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vt seges in pingui luxuriabit humo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This fault not greatlie gr&eacute;eued the people: for neither could anie one mans pleasure
stretch and extend to the displeasure of verie manie, and was without violence, and ouer
that in his latter daies lessed, and well left. In which time of his latter daies this realme
was in quiet and prosperous estate, no feare of outward enimies, no warre in hand,
nor none toward, but such as no man looked for. The people toward the prince, not
in a constrained feare, but in a willing and louing obedience: among themselues the
commons in good peace. The lords, whome h&eacute;e knew at variance, himselfe in his
death bed appeased: he had left all gathering of monie (which is the onelie thing
that withdraweth the hearts of English men from the prince) nor anie thing intended
he to take in hand, by which he should be driuen therto: for his tribute out of France
he had before obteined; and the yeare foregoing his death, he had obteined Berwike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e before pag. 705.</div>

<p>And albeit that all the time of his reigne he was with his people, so benigne, courteous,
and so familiar, that no part of his vertues was more est&eacute;emed: yet the condition
in the end of his daies (in which manie princes by a long continued souereigntie
decline into a proud port from debonair behauior of their beginning) maruellouslie in
him grew and increased: so farre foorth, that in summer (the last that euer h&eacute;e saw)
his highnesse being at Windsor in hunting, sent for the maior &amp; aldermen of London to
him for none other errand, but to haue them hunt &amp; be merrie with him, where he
made them not so statelie, but so fr&eacute;endlie and familiar ch&eacute;ere, and sent venison from
thence so freelie into the citie, that no one thing in manie daies before gat him either
more hearts, or more heartie fauour amongest the common people; which oftentimes
more est&eacute;eme and take for greater kindnesse a little courtesie, than a great benefit.</p>

<p>So deceassed (as I haue said) this noble king, in that time in which his life was most
desired. Whose loue of his people, and their entire affection towards him, had b&eacute;ene
to his noble children (hauing in themselues also as manie gifts of nature, as manie
princelie vertues, as much goodlie towardnesse as their age could receiue) a maruellous
fortresse and sure armor, if diuision and dissention of their fr&eacute;ends had not
vnarmed them, and left them destitute, and the execrable desire of souereigntie
prouoked him to their destruction: which if either kind or kindnesse had holden
place, must n&eacute;eds haue b&eacute;ene their ch&eacute;efe defense. For Richard the duke of Glocester,
by nature their vncle, by office their protector, to their father beholden, to themselues
by oth and allegiance bounden, all the bands broken that bind man and man togither,
without anie respect of God or the world, vnnaturallie contriued to ber&eacute;eue them, not
onelie their dignitie, but also their liues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard duke of Yorke.</div>

<p>But forsomuch as this dukes demeanor ministreth in effect all the whole matter
whereof this booke shall intreat, it is therefore conuenient somewhat to shew you yer
we further go, what maner of man this was, that could find in his hart such mischiefe
to conceiue. Richard duke of Yorke, a noble man and a mightie, began not by
warre, but by law to chalenge the crowne, putting his claime into the parlement,
where his cause was either for right or fauor so farre foorth aduanced, that king
Henrie his bloud (albeit he had a goodlie prince) vtterlie reiected, the crowne was by
authoritie of parlement intailed vnto the duke of Yorke and his issue male in remainder,
immediatlie after the death of king Henrie. But the duke not induring so
long to tarrie, but intending vnder pretext of dissention and debate arising in the
realme, to preuent his time, and to take vpon him the rule in king Henrie his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
was with manie nobles of the realme at Wakefield slaine, leauing thr&eacute;e sonnes, Edward
George, and Richard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edward.</div>

<div class="sidenote">George duke of Clarence.</div>

<p>All thr&eacute;e as they were great states of birth, so were they great and statelie of stomach,
greedie and ambitious of authoritie, and impatient of partners. Edward
reuenging his fathers death, depriued king Henrie, and atteined the crowne. George
duke of Clarence was a goodlie noble prince, and at all times fortunate, if either his
owne ambition had not set him against his brother, or the enuie of his enimies<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> his
brother against him. For were it by the qu&eacute;ene and lords of hir bloud, which highlie
maligned the kings kinred (as women commonlie not of malice, but of nature hate
them whome their husbands loue) or were a proud appetite of the duke himselfe,
intending to be king; at the least wise heinous treason was there laid to his charge:
and finallie, were h&eacute;e faultie, were he faultlesse, attainted was he by parlement, and
iudged to the death, and therevpon hastilie drowned in a butt of malmesie. Whose
death king Edward (albeit he commanded it) when he wist it was doone, pitiouslie
bewailed, and sorrowfullie repented.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Had not set.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The description of Richard the third.</div>

<p>Richard the third sonne, of whome we now intreat, was in wit and courage equall
with either of them, in bodie and prowesse farre vnder them both, litle of stature, ill
featured of limmes, crooke backed, his left shoulder much higher than his right,
hard fauoured of visage, and such as is in states called warilie, in other men otherwise;
he was malicious, wrathfull, enuious, and from afore his birth euer froward. It is for
truth reported, that the duchesse his mother had so much adoo in hir trauell, that she
could not be deliuered of him vncut; and that he came into the world with the f&eacute;et
forward, as men be borne outward, and (as the fame runneth also) not vntoothed,
whether men of hatred report aboue the truth, or else that nature changed hir course
in his beginning, which in the course of his life manie things vnnaturallie committed.
So that the full confluence of these qualities, with the defects of fauour and amiable
proportion, gaue proofe to this rule of physiognomic:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Distortum vultum sequitur distorsio morum.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>None euill capteine was he in the warre, as to which his disposition was more m&eacute;etlie
than for peace. Sundrie victories had he, &amp; sometimes ouerthrowes; but neuer on
default as for his owne person, either of hardinesse or politike order. Fr&eacute;e was he called
of dispense, and somewhat aboue his power liberall: with large gifts he gat him
vnstedfast fr&eacute;endship, for which he was faine to pill and spoile in other places, and
got him stedfast hatred. He was close and secret, a d&eacute;epe dissembler, lowlie of
countenance, arrogant of heart, outwardlie companiable where he inwardlie hated,
not letting to kisse whome he thought to kill: despitious and cruell, not for euill will
alway, but ofter for ambition, and either for the suertie or increase of his estate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The death of king Henrie the sixt.</div>

<p>Friend and fo was much what indifferent, where his aduantage grew, he spared no
mans death whose life withstoode his purpose. He slue with his owne hands
king Henrie the sixt, being prisoner in the Tower, as men constantlie said, and that without
commandement or knowledge of the king, which would vndoubtedlie (if he had
intended that thing) haue appointed that butcherlie office to some other, than his
owne borne brother. Some wise men also w&eacute;ene, that his drift courtlie conueied,
lacked not in helping foorth his brother of Clarence to his death: which he resisted
openlie, howbeit somewhat (as men d&eacute;emed) more faintlie than he that were hartilie
minded to his wealth.</p>

<p>And they that thus d&eacute;eme, thinke that he long time in king Edwards life forethought
to be king; in case that the king his brother (whose life he looked that euill
diet should shorten) should happen to deceasse (as in d&eacute;ed he did) while his children
were yoong. And they d&eacute;eme, that for this intent he was glad of his brothers death
the duke of Clarence, whose life must n&eacute;eds haue hindered him so intending, whether
the same duke of Clarence had kept him true to his nephue the yoong king, or enterprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>to be king himselfe. But of all this point is there no certeintie, and who so
diuineth vpon coniectures, maie as well shoot too farre as too short.</p>

<p>Howbeit this haue I by credible information learned, that the selfe night, in which
king Edward died, one Mistlebrooke, long yer morning, came in great hast to the
house of one Pottier dwelling in Redcrosse-str&eacute;et without Creplegate: and when he
was with hastie rapping quickelie letten in, he shewed vnto Pottier, that king Edward
was departed. "By my truth man" quoth Pottier, "then will my maister the duke of
Glocester be king." What cause he had so to thinke, hard it is to saie; whether he
being toward him, anie thing knew that he such thing purposed, or otherwise had
anie inckeling thereof: for he was not likelie to speake it of nought.</p>

<p>But now to returne to the course of this historie. Were it that the duke of Glocester
had of old foreminded this conclusion, or was now at erst therevnto mooued, and
put in hope by the occasion of the tender age of the yoong princes, his nephues (as
opportunitie &amp; likelihood of sp&eacute;ed putteth a man in courage of that he neuer intended)
certeine it is that he contriued their destruction, with the vsurpation of the regall
dignitie vpon himselfe. And forsomuch as he well wist and holpe to mainteine a long
continued grudge and heart-burning betw&eacute;ene the qu&eacute;ens kinred and the kings bloud,
either partie enuieng others authoritie, he now thought that their diuision should be (as
it was in d&eacute;ed) a furtherlie beginning to the pursuit of his intent.</p>

<p>Nay he was resolued, that the same was a sure ground for the foundation of all his
building, if he might first (vnder the pretext of reuenging of old displeasure) abuse
the anger and ignorance of the tone partie to the destruction of the tother; and then
win to his purpose as manie as he could, and those that could not be woone, might be
lost yer they looked therfore. For of one thing was he certeine, that if his intent
were perceiued, he should soone haue made peace betw&eacute;ene both the parties with
his owne bloud. King Edward in his life, albeit that this dissention betw&eacute;ene his
fr&eacute;ends somewhat irked him: yet in his good health he somewhat the lesse regarded it:
bicause he thought whatsoeuer businesse should fall betw&eacute;ene them, himselfe should
alwaie be able to rule both the parties.</p>

<p>But in his last sicknesse, when he perceiued his naturall strength so sore inf&eacute;ebled,
that he despaired all recouerie, then he, considering the youth of his children, albeit
he nothing lesse mistrusted than that that hapned; yet well fores&eacute;eing that manie
harmes might grow by their debate, while the youth of his children should lacke discretion
of themselues, &amp; good counsell of their fr&eacute;ends, of which either partie should
counsell for their owne commoditie, &amp; rather by pleasant aduise to win themselues
fauor, than by profitable aduertisement to doo the children good, he called some of
them before him that were at variance, and in especiall the lord marquesse Dorset the
qu&eacute;enes sonne by hir first husband.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hastings lord chamberleine maligned of the qu&eacute;ene &amp; hir kin.</div>

<p>So did he also William the lord Hastings a noble man, then lord chamberleine,
against whome the qu&eacute;ene speciallie grudged, for the great fauour the king bare him:
and also for that she thought him secretlie familiar with the king in wanton companie.
Hir kinred also bare him sore, as well for that the king had made him capteine
of Calis, which office the lord Riuers, brother to the qu&eacute;ene, claimed of the
kings former promise, as for diuerse other great gifts which he receiued, that they
looked for. When these lords, with diuerse other of both the parties, were come in
presence, the king lifting vp himselfe, and vnderset with pillowes, as it is reported,
on this wise said vnto them.</p>


<h2>The oration of the king on his death-bed.</h2>

<p>My lords, my d&eacute;ere kinsmen and alies, in what plight I lie you s&eacute;e, and I feele. By
which the lesse while I looke to liue with you, the more deepelie am I mooued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
care in what case I leaue you, for such as I leaue you, such be my children like to find
you. Which if they should (as God forbid) find you at variance, might hap to fall
themselues at warre, yer their discretion would serue to set you at peace. Ye s&eacute;e
their youth, of which I reckon the onelie suertie to rest in your concord. For it
sufficeth not that all you loue them, if ech of you hate other: if they were men, your
faithfulnesse happilie would suffice. But childhood must be mainteined by mens authoritie,
and slipper youth vnderpropped with elder counsell, which neither they can
haue but ye giue it, nor ye giue it if ye gree not.</p>

<p>For where ech laboureth to breake that the other maketh, and for hatred of ech of
others person impugneth ech others counsell, there must it n&eacute;eds be long yer anie
good conclusion go forward. And also while either partie laboureth to be ch&eacute;efe,
flatterie shall haue more place than plaine and faithfull aduise: of which must n&eacute;eds
insue the euill bringing vp of the prince, whose mind in tender youth infect, shall redilie
fall to misch&eacute;efe and riot, and draw dowue with his noble relme to ruine. But if
grace turne him to wisedome: which if God send, then they that by euill meanes before
pleased him best, shall after fall furthest out of fauour: so that euer at length
euill drifts shall draw to nought, and good plaine waies prosper.</p>

<p>Great variance hath there long b&eacute;ene betw&eacute;ene you, not alwaie for great causes.
Sometimes a thing right well intended, our misconstruction turneth vnto woorse; or
a small displeasure doone vs, either our owne affection or euill toongs aggreeueth.
But this wot I well, ye neuer had so great cause of hatred, as ye haue of loue. That
we be all men, that we be christian men, this shall I leaue for preachers to tell you;
and yet I wot n&eacute;ere whether anie preachers words ought more to mooue you, than his
that is by &amp; by going to the place that they all preach of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature of ambition.</div>

<p>But this shall I desire you to remember, that the one part of you is of my bloud, the
other of mine alies; and ech of you with other either of kinred or affinitie; which
spirituall kinred of affinitie, if the sacraments of Christs church beare that weight
with vs that would God they did, should no lesse mooue vs to charitie, than the respect
of fleshlie consanguinitie. Our Lord forbid, that you loue together the woorse,
for the selfe cause that you ought to loue the better. And yet that happeneth, and no
where find we so deadlie debate, as among them, which by nature and law most ought
to agr&eacute;e togither. Such a pestilent serpent is ambition and desire of vaine glorie and
souereigntie, which among states where she once entereth, creepeth foorth so farre,
till with diuision and variance she turneth all to misch&eacute;efe: first longing to be next
vnto the best, afterward equall with the best, &amp; at last ch&eacute;efe and aboue the best.</p>

<p>Of which immoderate appetite of worship, and thereby of debate and dissention,
what losse, what sorow, what trouble hath within these few yeares growne in this
realme, I praie God as well forget, as we well remember. Which things if I could
as well haue foreseene, as I haue with my more paine than pleasure prooued, by Gods
blessed ladie (that was euer his oth) I would neuer haue woone the courtesie of mens
kn&eacute;es, with the losse of so manie heads. But sithens things passed can not be gaine
called, much ought we the more beware, by what occasion we haue taken so great
hurt afore, that we eftsoones fall not in that occasion againe.</p>

<p>Now be those greefs passed, and all is (God be thanked) quiet, and likelie right
well to prosper in wealthfull peace vnder your coosins my children, if God send them
life and you loue. Of which two things, the lesse losse were they, by whom though
God did his pleasure, yet should the realme alwaie find kings, and peraduenture as
good kings.</p>

<p>But if you among your selues in a childs reigne fall at debate, manie a good man
shall perish, and happilie he too, and ye too, yer this land find peace againe. Wherfore
in these last words that euer I looke to speake with you, I exhort you and require
you all, for the loue that you haue euer borne to me; for the loue that I haue euer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
borne vnto you; for the loue that our Lord beareth to vs all; from this time forward
(all greefs forgotten) ech of you loue other. Which I verilie trust you will, if ye anie
thing earthlie regard, either God or your king, affinitie or kinred, this realme, your
owne countrie, or your owne suertie. And therewithall the king no longer induring
to sit vp, laid him downe on his right side, his face towards them: and none was there
present that could refraine from w&eacute;eping.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A counterfet and pretended reconcilement.</div>

<p>But the lords recomforting him with as good words as they could, and answering
for the time as they thought to stand with his pleasure, there in his presence, as by
their words appeared, ech forgaue other, and ioined their hands togither, when (as it
after appeared by their d&eacute;eds) their hearts were farre asunder. As soone as the king
was departed, the noble prince his sonne drew toward London, which at the time of
his deceasse kept his houshold at Ludlow in Wales, which countrie being farre off
from the law and recourse to iustice, was begun to be farre out of good rule, and
waxen wild robbers and reauers, walking at libertie vncorrected. And for this occasion
the prince was in the life of his father sent thither, to the end that the authoritie
of his presence should refraine euill disposed persons from the boldnesse of their former
outrages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Riuers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Glocesters solicitations.</div>

<p>To the gouernance and ordering of this yoong prince at his sending thither, was
there appointed sir Anthonie Wooduile lord Riuers, and brother vnto the qu&eacute;ene, a
right honourable man, as valiant of hand as politike in counsell. Adioined were there
vnto him other of the same partie; and in effect euerie one as he was n&eacute;erest of kin
vnto the qu&eacute;ene, so was he planted next about the prince. That drift by the qu&eacute;ene
not vnwiselie deuised, whereby hir bloud might of youth be rooted into the princes
fauour, the duke of Glocester turned vnto their destruction; and vpon that ground
set the foundation of all his vnhappie building. For whome soeuer he perceiued either
at variance with them, or bearing himselfe their fauour, he brake vnto them some
by mouth, &amp; some by writing.</p>

<p>Nay, he sent secret messengers saieng, that it neither was reason, nor in anie wise to
be suffered, that the yoong king their maister and kinsman, should be in the hands
and custodie of his mother's kinred, sequestred in maner from their companie and attendance,
of which euerie one ought him as faithfull seruice as they, and manie of
them farre more honourable part of kin than his mother's side. Whose bloud (quoth
he) sauing the kings pleasure, was full vnm&eacute;etelie to be matched with his: which
now to be as who say remooued from the king, and the lesse noble to be left about
him, is (quoth he) neither honourable to his maiestie nor to vs, and also to his grace
no suertie, to haue the mightiest of his fr&eacute;ends from him; and vnto vs no little
ieopardie, to suffer our well prooued euill willers to grow in ouer-great authoritie with
the prince in youth; namelie, which is light of bel&eacute;efe and soone persuaded.</p>

<p>Y&eacute;e remember (I trow) king Edward himselfe, albeit he was a man of age &amp; discretion,
yet was he in manie things ruled by the bend, more than stood either with
his honor, or our profit, or with the c&#333;moditie of any man else, except onlie the
immoderate aduancement of themselues. Which, whether they sorer thirsted after
their owne weale, or our wo, it were hard (I w&eacute;ene) to gesse. And if some folks
fr&eacute;endship had not holden better place with the king, than anie respect of kinred,
they might peraduenture easilie haue betrapped and brought to confusion some of vs
yer this. Why not as easilie as they haue doone some other alreadie, as n&eacute;ere of his
roiall bloud as we? But our Lord hath wrought his will, and (thanks be to his grace)
that perill is past. Howbeit as great is growing, if we suffer this yoong king in our
enimies hand, which without his witting might abuse the name of his commandement,
to anie of our vndooing, which thing God [defend] and good prouision
forbid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A consent to worke wickednesse.</div>

<p>Of which good prouision none of vs hath anie thing the lesse n&eacute;ed, for the late
made attonement, in which the kings pleasure had more place than the parties willes.
Nor none of vs (I bel&eacute;eue) is so vnwise, ouersoone to trust a new fr&eacute;end made of an
old fo; or to thinke that an hourlie kindnesse, suddenlie contracted in one houre, continued
yet scant a fortnight, should be d&eacute;eper settled in their stomachs, than a long
accustomed malice manie yeares rooted. With these words and writings, and such
other, the duke of Glocester soone set on fire them that were of themselues easie to
kindle, &amp; in speciallie twaine, Edward duke of Buckingham, and William lord Hastings
then chamberleine, both men of honour &amp; of great power; the one by long succession
from his ancestrie, the other by his office and the kings fauour. These two, not bearing
ech to other so much loue, as hatred both vnto the qu&eacute;enes part: in this point accorded
togither with the duke of Glocester, that they would vtterlie remoue from the
kings companie all his mothers fr&eacute;ends, vnder the name of their enimies.</p>

<p>Vpon this concluded the duke of Glocester, vnderstanding that the lords, which at
that time were about the king, intended to bring him vp to his coronation acc&#333;panied
with such power of their fr&eacute;ends, that it should be hard for him to bring his purpose
to passe, without the gathering and great assemblie of people and in maner of open
warre, whereof the end (he wist) was doubtfull, and in which the king being on
their side, his part should haue the face and name of a rebellion: he secretlie therfore
by diuers means caused the qu&eacute;ene to be persuaded and brought in the mind, that it
neither were n&eacute;ed, and also should be ieopardous, the king to come vp strong.</p>

<p>For whereas now euerie lord loued other, and none other thing studied vpon, but
about the coronation and honor of the king: if the lords of hir kindred should assemble
in the kings name much people, they should giue the lords, betwixt whome
and them had b&eacute;ene sometime debate, to feare and suspect, least they should gather
this people, not for the kings safegard, whom no man impugned, but for their destruction,
hauing more regard to their old variance, than their new attonement. For
which cause they should assemble on the other partie much people againe for their
defense, whose power she wist well far stretched: and thus should all the realme
fall on a rore. And of all the hurt that thereof should insue, which was likelie not
to be little, and the most harme there like to fall where she least would, all the world
would put hir and hir kindered in the wight, and saie that they had vnwiselie and vntrulie
also broken the amitie &amp; peace that the king hir husband so prudentlie made,
betw&eacute;ene his kin and hirs in his death bed and which the other partie faithfullie obserued.</p>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene, being in this wise persuaded, such word sent vnto hir sonne, and vnto
hir brother being about the king, and ouer that the duke of Glocester himselfe and
other lords the chiefe of his bend, wrote vnto the king so reuerentlie, and to the
qu&eacute;enes fr&eacute;ends there so louinglie, that they nothing earthlie mistrusting, brought
the king vp in great hast, not in good sp&eacute;ed, with a sober companie. Now was the
king in his waie to London gone from Northampton, when these dukes of Glocester
and Buckingham came thither, where remained behind the lord Riuers the kings vncle,
intending on the morrow to follow the king, and to be with him at Stonie Stratford
[certeine] miles thence earlie yer he departed. So was there made that night much
fr&eacute;endlie ch&eacute;ere betw&eacute;ene these dukes &amp; the lord Riuers a great while, but inc&#333;tinent,
after that they were openlie with great courtesie departed, and the lord Riuers lodged,
the dukes secretlie with a few of their most priuie fr&eacute;ends set them downe in councell,
wherein they spent a great part of the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The practices of the duke of Buckingham &amp; Glocester.</div>

<p>And at their rising in the dawning of the daie, they sent about priuilie to their seruants
in their Ins &amp; lodgings about, giuing them commandement to make themselues
shortlie readie, for their lords were to horsse backeward. Vpon which messages, manie
of their folke were attendant, when manie of the lord Riuers seruants were vnreadie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
Now had these dukes taken also into their custodie the keies of the In, that
none should passe foorth without their licence. And ouer this, in the high waie toward
Stonie Stratford, where the king lay, they had bestowed certeine of their folke, that
should send backe againe, and compell to returne, anie man that were gotten out of
Northampton, toward Stonie Stratford, till they should giue other licence. For as much
as the dukes themselues intended for the shew of their diligence, to be the first
that should that daie attend vpon the kings highnesse out of that towne. Thus bare
they folke in hand.</p>

<p>But when the lord Riuers vnderstood the gates closed, and the waies on euerie side
beset, neither his seruants nor himselfe suffered to gone out, perceiuing well so great
a thing without his knowledge not begun for naught, comparing this manner present
with this last nights ch&eacute;ere, in so few houres so great a change, maruellouslie misliked.
Howbeit, sith he could not get awaie, and k&eacute;epe himselfe close, he would not,
least he should s&eacute;eme to hide himselfe for some secret feare of his owne fault, whereof
he saw no such cause in himselfe; he determined vpon the suertie of his owne conscience,
to go boldlie to them, and inquire what this matter might meane. Whom
as soone as they saw, they began to quarrell with him and saie that he intended to set
distance betw&eacute;ene the king and them, and to bring them to confusion, but it should
not lie in his power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Riuers put in ward.</div>

<p>And when he began (as he was a verie well spoken man) in goodlie wise to excuse
himselfe, they tarried not the end of his answer, but shortlie tooke him, and put him
in ward, and that doone, foorthwith went to horssebacke, and tooke the waie to Stonie
Stratford, where they found the king with his companie, readie to leape on
horssebacke, and depart forward to leaue that lodging for them, bicause it was too
streight for both companies. And as soone as they came in his presence, they light
adowne with all their companie about them. To whome the duke of Buckingham
said; Go afore gentlemen, &amp; yeomen k&eacute;epe your roomes. And thus in a goodlie
araie, they came to the king, and on their kn&eacute;es in verie humble wise saluted his
grace, which receiued them in verie ioious and amiable manner, nothing earthlie knowing
nor mistrusting as yet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Greie is quarrelled against.</div>

<p>But euen by and by in his presence they piked a quarrell to the lord Richard Greie;
the kings other brother by his mother, saieng, that he with the lord marquesse his
brother, &amp; the lord Riuers his vncle, had compassed to rule the king and the realme,
and to set variance among the states, and to subdue and destroie the noble bloud of
the Realme. Toward the acc&#333;plishing wherof they said that the lord marquesse had
entered into the Tower of London, &amp; thence taken out the kings treasure, and sent
men to the sea. All which things these dukes wist well were doone for good
purposes and necessarie, by the whole councell at London, sauing that somewhat they
must saie.</p>

<p>Vnto which words the king answered; What my brother marquesse hath doone I
cannot saie, but in good faith I dare well answer for mine vncle Riuers and my brother
here, that they be innocent of anie such matter. Yea my liege (quoth the duke of
Buckingham) they haue kept their dealing in these matters farre fro the knowledge of
your good grace. And foorthwith they arrested the lord Richard and sir Thomas
Vaughan knight, in the kings presence; and brought the king and all backe vnto Northampton,
where they tooke againe further councell. And there they sent awaie from
the king, whom it pleased them, and set new seruants about him, such as liked
better them than him. At which dealing he wept, and was nothing content; but it
booted not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The death of the lord Rivers &amp; other.</div>

<p>And at dinner, the duke of Glocester sent a dish from his owne table vnto the lord
Riuers, praieng him to be of good ch&eacute;ere: all should be well inough. And he thanked
the duke, and praied the messenger to beare it to his nephue the lord Richard, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the same message for his comfort, who he thought had more n&eacute;ed of comfort, as one
to whome such aduersitie was strange. But himselfe had b&eacute;ene all his dates in vse
therewith, &amp; therefore could beare it the better. But for all this comfortable courtesie
of the duke of Glocester, he sent the lord Riuers, and the lord Richard, with sir
Thomas Vaughan into the north countrie, into diuerse places to prison, and afterward
all to Pomfret, where they were in conclusion beheaded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene taketh sanctuarie.</div>

<p>In this wise the duke of Glocester tooke vpon himselfe the order and gouernance of
the yoong king, whome with much honor and humble reuerence he conueied vpward
towards the citie. But anon, the tidings of this matter came hastilie to the qu&eacute;ene a
little before the midnight following, and that in the sorest wise; that the king hir
son was taken, hir brother, hir sonne, &amp; hir other fr&eacute;ends arrested, and sent no man
wist whither, to be doone with God wot what. With which tidings the qu&eacute;ene in
great flight &amp; heauinesse, bewailing hir childes reigne, hir fr&eacute;ends mischance, and hir
owne infortune, damning the time that euer she dissuaded the gathering of power about
the king, gat hir selfe in all the hast possible with hir yoonger sonne and hir daughters
out of the palace of Westminster, in which she then laie, into the sanctuarie, lodging
hir selfe and hir companie therein the abbats place.</p>

<p>Now came there one in likewise not long after midnight from the lord chamberleine,
to doctor Rotheram the archbishop of Yorke, then chancellor of England, to his
place not farre from Westminster, and for that he shewed his seruants that he had
tidings of so great importance, that his maister gaue him in charge, not to forbeare his
rest, they letted not to wake him, nor he to admit this messenger in, to his bed side.
Of whom he heard that these dukes were gone backe with the kings grace from
Stonie Stratford vnto Northampton. Notwithstanding sir (quoth he) my lord sendeth
your lordship word, that there is no feare: for he assureth you that all shall be well.
I assure him (quoth the archbishop) be it as well as it will, it will neuer be so well as
we haue s&eacute;ene it.</p>

<p>And therevpon, by and by after the messenger departed, he caused in all the hast all
his seruants to be called vp, and so with his owne houshold about him, and euerie man
weaponed, he tooke the great seale with him, and came yet before daie vnto the qu&eacute;ene.
About whom he found much heauinesse, rumble, hast and businesse, carriage and conueiance
of hir stuffe into sanctuarie, chests, coffers, packs, fardels, trussed all on mens
backs, no man vnoccupied, some lading, some going, some discharging, some comming
for more, some breaking downe the walles to bring in the next waie, and some
yet drew to them that holpe to carrie a wrong waie: such made their lucre of others
losse, praising a bootie aboue beautie, to whome the poets verse may be well applied,
to wit:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tibul. lib. 2. eleg. 3.</i></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ferrea non Venerem sed pr&aelig;dem s&aelig;cula laudant.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The desolate state of the qu&eacute;ene.</div>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene hir selfe sate alone alow on the rushes all desolate and dismaid, whome
the archbishop comforted in best manner he could, shewing hir that he trusted the
matter was nothing so sore as she tooke it for, and that he was put in good hope and
out of feare by the message sent him from the lord chamberleine. Ah wo woorth him
(quoth she) for he is one of them that laboureth to destroie me and my bloud. Madame
(quoth he) be y&eacute;e of good ch&eacute;ere, for I assure you, if they crowne anie other king than
your sonne, whome they now haue with them, we shall on the morrow crowne his
brother, whome you haue here with you. And here is the great seale, which in likewise
as that noble prince your husband deliuered it vnto me; so here I deliuer it vnto
you, to the vse and behoofe of your sonne: and therewith he betooke hir the great
scale, and departed home againe, yet in the dawning of the daie.</p>

<p>By which time, he might in his chamber window s&eacute;e all the Thames full of boates
of the duke of Glocesters seruants, watching that no man should go to sanctuarie,
nor none could passe vnsearched. Then was there great commotion and murmur, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
well in other places about, as speciallie in the citie, the people diuerslie diuining vpon
this dealing. And some lords, knights, and gentlemen, either for fauour of the
qu&eacute;ene, or for feare of themselues, assembled in sundrie companies, and went flockmele
in harnesse: and many also, for that they reckoned this demeanor attempted, not so
speciallie against the other lords, as against the king himselfe in the disturbance
of his coronation. But then by and by the lords assembled togither at [a certeine
place.]</p>

<div class="sidenote">Neuerthelesse he was depriued thereof shortlie after.</div>

<p>Toward which m&eacute;eting, the archbishop of Yorke fearing that it would be ascribed
(as it was ind&eacute;ed) to his ouermuch lightnesse, that he so suddenlie had y&eacute;elded vp the
great seale to the qu&eacute;ene, to whome the custodie thereof nothing perteined, without
especiall commandement of the king, secretlie sent for the seale againe, and brought
it with him after the customable maner. And at this m&eacute;eting the lord Hastings (whose
truth toward the king no man doubted, nor n&eacute;eded to doubt) persuaded the lords to
bel&eacute;eue, that the duke of Glocester was sure and fastlie faithfull to his prince, and
that the lord Riuers, and lord Richard with the other knights, were for matters attempted
by them against the duke of Glocester and Buckingham, put vnder arrest
for their suertie, not for the kings ieopardie: and that they were also in safegard, and
there no longer should remaine, than till the matter were, not by the dukes onelie, but
also by all the other lords of the kings councell indifferentlie examined, &amp; by others
discretions ordered, and either iudged or appeased.</p>

<p>But one thing he aduised them beware, that they iudged not the matter too farre
foorth, yer they knew the truth; nor turning their priuate grudges into the common
hurt, irriting and prouoking men vnto anger, and disturbing the kings coronation,
towards which the dukes were comming vp, that they might peraduenture bring the
matter so farre out of ioint, that it should neuer be brought in frame againe. Which
strife if it should hap (as it were likely) to come to a field, though both parties were in
all other things equall; yet should the authoritie be on that side where the king is
himselfe. With these persuasions of the lord Hastings, whereof part himselfe
bel&eacute;eued, of part he wist the contrarie, these commotions were somewhat appeased.
But speciallie by that, that the dukes of Glocester and Buckingham were so n&eacute;ere and
came so shortlie on with the king, in none other manner, with none other voice or
semblance than to his coronation, causing the fame to be blowen about, that these
lords and knights which were taken, had contriued the destruction of the dukes of
Glocester and Buckingham, and of other noble bloud of the realme, to the end that
themselues would alone demeane and gouerne the king at their pleasure.</p>

<p>And for the colourable proofe thereof, such of the dukes seruants as rode with the
carts of their stuffe that were taken (among which stuffe, no maruell though some
were harnesse, which at the breaking vp of that houshold must n&eacute;eds either be
brought awaie or cast awaie) they shewed vnto the people all the waies as they went;
"Lo here be the barrels of harnesse that these traitors had priuilie conueied in their carriage
to destroie the noble lords withall." This deuise albeit that it made the matter
to wise men more vnlikelie, well perceiuing that the intendors of such a purpose

barrels, yet much part of the common people were therewith verie well satisfied, and
said it were almesse to hang them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's comming to London.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Glocester made protector.</div>

<p>When the king approched n&eacute;ere to the citie, Edmund Shaw goldsmith, then maior,
with William White, and Iohn Matthew shiriffes and all the other aldermen in scarlet,
with fiue hundred horsse of the citizens, in violet, receiued him reuerentlie at Harnesie;
and riding from thence accompanied him into the citie, which he entered the fourth
daie of Maie, the first and last yeare of his reigne. But the duke of Glocester bare
him in open sight so reuerentlie to the prince, with all semblance of lowlinesse, that
from the great obloquie in which he was so late before, he was suddenlie fallen in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
great trust, that at the councell next assembled he was made the onelie man, chosen
and thought most m&eacute;et to be protector of the king and his realme, so that (were it
destinie or were it follie) the lambe was betaken to the woolfe to k&eacute;epe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Lincolne made lord chancellor.</div>

<p>At which councell also, the archbishop of Yorke chancellor of England, which had
deliuered vp the great seale to the qu&eacute;ene, was thereof greatlie reprooued, and the seale
taken from him, and deliuered to doctor Russell bishop of Lincolne, a wise man and a
good, and of much experience, and one of the best learned men vndoubtedlie that
England had in his time. Diuerse lords and knights were appointed vnto diuerse
roomes. The lord chamberleine and some other kept still their offices that they had
before. Now all were it so that the protector so sore thirsted for the finishing of that
he had begun, that thought euerie daie a yeare till it were atchiued; yet durst he no
further attempt, as long as he had but halfe his preie in his hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The protectors oration.</div>

<p>And why? Well did he w&eacute;et, that if he deposed the one brother, all the realme
would fall to the other, if he either remained in sanctuarie, or should happilie be shortlie
conueied to his fathers libertie. Wherfore incontinent at the next m&eacute;eting of the lords
at the councell, he proposed to them, that it was a heinous d&eacute;ed of the qu&eacute;ene, &amp; proc&eacute;eding
of great malice toward the kings councellors, that she should k&eacute;epe in sanctuarie
the kings brother from him, whose speciall pleasure &amp; comfort were to haue his
brother with him. And that by hir doone to none other intent, but to bring all the
lords in obloquie and murmur of the people.</p>

<p>As though they were not to be trusted with the kings brother, that by the assent of
the nobles of the land, were appointed as the kings n&eacute;erest fr&eacute;ends, to the tuition of
his owne roiall person. The prosperitie whereof standeth (quoth he) not all in k&eacute;eping
from enimies, or ill viand, but partlie also in recreation, and moderate pleasure:
which he cannot (in this tender youth) take in the companie of ancient persons, but
in the familiar conuersation of those that be neither farre vnder, nor farre aboue his
age: and neuerthelesse of estate conuenient to accompanie his noble maiestie. Wherefore,
with whome rather, than with his owne brother?</p>

<p>And if anie man thinke this consideration light (which I thinke none thinks that
loues the king) let him consider, that sometime without small things, greater cannot
stand. And verelie, it redoundeth greatlie to the dishonor both of the kings highnesse,
and of all vs that b&eacute;ene about his grace, to haue it run in euerie mans mouth,
not in this realme onlie, but also in other lands (as euill words walke far) that the kings
brother should be faine to k&eacute;epe sanctuarie. For euerie man will w&eacute;ene, that no man
will so doo for naught. And such euill opinion once fastned in mens harts, hard it is to
wrest out, and may grow to more gr&eacute;efe than anie man can here diuine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord cardinall thought the fittest man to deale with the qu&eacute;ene for the surrendring of hir sonne.</div>

<p>Wherefore me thinketh it were not worst to send vnto the qu&eacute;ene, for the redresse
of this matter, some honorable trustie man, such as both tendereth the kings weale
and the honour of his councell, and is also in fauour and credence with hir. For all
which considerations, none s&eacute;emeth more m&eacute;etlie, than our reuerend father here present
my lord cardinall, who may in this matter doo most good of anie man, if it
please him to take the paine; which I doubt not of his goodnesse he will not refuse
for the kings sake and ours, and wealth of the yoong duke himselfe, the kings most
honorable brother, and (after my souereigne lord himselfe) my most d&eacute;ere nephue, considered
that thereby shall be ceassed the slanderous rumor and obloquie now going, and
the hurts auoided that thereof might insue, and much rest and quiet grow to all the
realme.</p>

<p>And if she be percase so obstinate, and so preciselie set vpon hir owne will, that
neither his wise and faithfull aduertisement can not mooue hir, nor anie mans reason
content hir; then shall we by mine aduise, by the kings authoritie fetch him out of
that prison, and bring him to his noble presence, in whose continual companie he shall
be so well cherished and so honorablie intreated, that all the world shall to our honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
and hir reproch perceiue that it was onelie malice, frowardnesse, or follie, that caused
hir to k&eacute;epe him there. This is my purpose and mind in this matter for this time,
except anie of your lordships anie thing perceiue to the contrarie; for neuer shall I
(by Gods grace) so wed myselfe to mine owne will, but that I shall be readie to change
it vpon your better aduises.</p>

<p>When the protector had said, all the councell affirmed, that the motion was good
and reasonable; and to the king and the duke his brother, honorable; and a thing that
should ceasse great murmur in the realme, if the mother might be by good means induced
to deliuer him. Which thing the archbishop of Yorke, whome they all agr&eacute;ed
also to be thereto most conuenient, tooke vpon him to mooue hir, and therein to doo
his vttermost deuoir. Howbeit, if she could be in no wise intreated with hir good
will to deliuer him, then thought he, and such other as were of the spiritualtie present,
that it were not in anie wise to be attempted to take him out against hir will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons why it was not thought m&eacute;et to fetch the qu&eacute;ens son out of sanctuarie.</div>

<p>For it should be a thing that would turne to the great grudge of all men, and high
displeasure of God, if the priuilege of that holie place should now be broken, which
had so manie yeares be kept, which both kings and popes so good had granted, so
manie had confirmed, and which holie ground was more than fiue hundred yeares ago
(by saint Peter in his owne person in spirit accompanied with great multitudes of
angels by night) so speciallie halowed, &amp; dedicated to God (for the proofe wherof,
they haue yet in the abbeie saint Peters cope to shew) that from that time hitherward,
was there neuer so vndeuout a king that durst that sacred place violate, or so holie a
bishop that durst it presume to consecrate.</p>

<p>And therefore (quoth the archbishop of Yorke) God forbid that anie man should
for anie thing earthlie, enterprise to breake the immunitie &amp; libertie of the sacred
sanctuarie, that hath b&eacute;ene the safegard of so manie a good mans life. And I trust
(quoth he) with God grace, we shall not n&eacute;ed it. But for anie maner n&eacute;ed, I would
not we should doo it. I trust that sh&eacute;e shall be with reason contented, and all things
in good maner obteined. And if it happen that I bring it not so to passe, yet shall I
toward it so farre foorth doo my best, that ye shall all well perceiue, that no lacke
of my deuoir, but the mother's dread and womanish feare shall be the let.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The duke of Buckingh&#257;s words against the qu&eacute;ene.</div>

<p>Womanish feare, naie womanish frowardnesse (quoth the duke of Buckingham.)
For I dare take it vpon my soule, she well knoweth she n&eacute;edeth no such thing to feare,
either for hir son or for hir selfe. For as for hir, here is no man that will be at war
with women. Would God some of the men of hir kin were women too, &amp; then
should all be soone in rest. Howbeit there is none of hir kin the lesse loued, for that
they be hir kin, but for their owne euill deseruing. And nathelesse, if we loued neither
hir nor hir kin, yet were there no cause to thinke that wee should hate the kings noble
brother, to whose grace we our selues be of kin. Whose honor, if she as much desired
as our dishonor, and as much regard tooke to his wealth as to hir owne will, she would
be as loth to suffer him to be absent from the king, as anie of vs be. For if she
haue anie wit (as would God she had as good will as she hath shrewd wit) she
reckoneth hir selfe no wiser than she thinketh some that be here, of whose faithfull
mind she nothing doubteth, but verelie bel&eacute;eueth and knoweth, that they would be as
sorie of his harme as hir selfe, and yet would haue him from hir if she bide there: and
we all (I thinke) contented, that both be with hir, if she come thence, and bide in
such place where they may with their honors be. Now then, if she refuse in the
deliuerance of him, to follow the counsell of them, whose wisdome she knoweth
whose truth she well trusteth: it is easie to perceiue, that frowardnesse letteth hir
and not feare. But go to, suppose that she feare (as who maie let hir to feare hir owne
shadow) the more she feareth to deliuer him the more ought we feare to leaue him in
hir hands.</p>

<p>For if she cast such fond doubts, that she feare his hurt: then will she feare that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
shall be fet thence. For she will soone thinke, that if men were set (which God
forbid) vpon so great mischiefe, the sanctuarie would little let them: which good men
might (as me thinketh) without sin somewhat lesse regard than they doo. Now
then, if she doubt, least he might be fetched from hir, is it not likelie inough that she
shall send him some where out of the realme? Verelie I looke for none other. And I
doubt not, but sh&eacute;e now as sore mindeth it, as we the let thereof. And if she might
happen to bring that to passe (as it were no great maistrie, we letting hir alone) all
the world would saie, that we were a wise sort of councellors about a king, that let
his brother be cast awaie vnder our noses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of sanctuaries.</div>

<p>And therefore, I insure you faithfullie for my mind, I will rather (mauger hir mind)
fetch him awaie, than leaue him there, till hir frowardnesse and fond feare conueie
him awaie. And yet will I breake no sanctuarie therefore. For verelie, sith the
priuileges of that place, and other like, haue b&eacute;ene of long continued, I am not he
that would be about to breake them. And in good faith, if they were now to begin,
I would not be he that should be about to make them. Yet will I not say naie, but
that it is a d&eacute;ed of pitie, that such men as the sea, or their euill debtors haue brought
in pouertie, should haue some place of libertie, to k&eacute;epe their bodies out of danger of
their cruell creditors.</p>

<p>And also, if the crowne happen (as it hath doone) to come in question, while either
part taketh other as traitors, I will well there be some places of refuge for both. But
as for th&eacute;eues, of which these places be full, and which neuer fall from the craft, after
they once fall thereto, it is pitie the sanctuarie should serue them. And much more,
mankillers, whome God bad to take them from the altar and kill them, if their mother
were wilfull. And where it is otherwise, there n&eacute;ed we not the sanctuaries that
God appointed in the old law. For if either necessitie, his owne defense, or misfortune
draweth him to that d&eacute;ed, a pardon serueth, which either the law granteth of course,
or the king of pitie maie. Then looke me now how few sanctuarie men there be, whome
anie fauourable necessitie compelled to go thither. And then s&eacute;e on the other side,
what a sort there be commonlie therin of them, whom wilfull vnthriftinesse hath
brought to naught.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Westminster and saint Martins.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The abuse of sanctuaries.</div>

<p>What a rabble of th&eacute;eues, murtherers, and malicious heinous traitors, and that in
two places speciallie; the one at the elbow of the citie, the other in the verie bowels.
I dare well auow it, weie the good that they doo, with the hurt that commeth of
them, and ye shall find it much better to lacke both, than haue both. And this I saie,
although they were not abused as they now be, &amp; so long haue be, that I feare me
euer they will be, while men be afraid to set their hands to the mendment, as though
God &amp; S. Peter were the patrones of vngratious liuing. Now vnthrifts riot &amp; run in
debt, vpon boldnesse of these places, yea, and rich men run thither with poore mens
goods, there they build, there they spend, &amp; bid there creditors go whistle them.
Mens wiues run thither with their husbands plate, &amp; saie they dare not abide with
their husbands for beating. Th&eacute;eues bring thither their stollen goods, and there liue
thereon.</p>

<p>There deuise they new robberies, nightlie they steale out, they rob, and reaue, and
kill, and come in againe, as though those places gaue them not onelie a safegard for
the harme they haue doone, but a licence also to doo more. Howbeit, much of this mischiefe
(if wise men would set their hands to it) might be amended, with great thanks
to God, and no breach of the priuilege. The residue, sith so long ago, I wote n&eacute;ere
what pope, and what prince more pitious than politike, hath granted it, &amp; other men
since, of a certeine religious feare, haue not broken it, let vs take a paine therewith, and
let it a Gods name stand in force, as farre foorth as reason will, which is not fullie so
farre foorth, as may serue to let vs of the fetching foorth of this noble man to his
honor and wealth, out of that place, in which he neither is, nor can be a sanctuarie man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The vse of sanctuaries.</div>

<p>A sanctuarie serueth alwaie to defend the bodie of that man that standeth in danger
abroad, not of great hurt onlie, but also of lawfull hurt: for against vnlawfull
harmes, neuer pope nor king intended to priuilege anie one place, for that priuilege
hath euerie place. Knoweth anie man, anie place wherein it is lawfull one man to
doo another wrong? That no man vnlawfullie take hurt, that libertie, the king, the
law, and verie nature forbiddeth in euerie place, and maketh (to that regard) for euerie
man euerie place a sanctuarie. But where a man is by lawfull means in perill, there n&eacute;edeth
he the tuition of some speciall priuilege, which is the onelie ground and cause of
all sanctuaries.</p>

<p>From which necessitie, this noble prince is farre, whose loue to his king, nature and
kinred prooueth; whose innocencie to all the world, his tender youth prooueth; and
so sanctuarie, as for him, neither none he n&eacute;edeth, nor also none can haue. Men come
not to sanctuarie, as they come to baptisme, to require it by their godfathes, he must
aske it himselfe that must haue it, and reason; sith no man hath cause to haue it, but
whose conscience of his owne fault maketh him fane, n&eacute;ed to require it. What will
then hath yonder babe, which and if he had discretion to require it, if n&eacute;ed were, I
dare say would now be right angrie with them that k&eacute;epe him there? And I would thinke
without anie scruple of conscience, without anie breach of priuilege, to be somewhat
more homelie with them that be there sanctuarie men in d&eacute;ed.</p>

<p>For if one go to sanctuarie with another mans goods, whie should not the king,
leauing his bodie at libertie, satisfie the partie of his goods, euen within the sanctuarie?
For neither king nor pope can giue anie place such a priuilege, that it shall discharge
a man of his debts, being able to paie. [And with that, diuerse of the clergie
that were present (whether they said it for his pleasure, or as they thought) agr&eacute;ed
plainlie, that by the law of God, and of the church, the goods of a sanctuarie man
should be deliuered in paiment of his debts, and stollen goods to the owner, and onlie
libertie reserued him to get his liuing with the labor of his hands.]</p>

<p>Verelie (quoth the duke) I thinke you say verie truth. And what if a mans wife
will take sanctuarie, bicause she lust to run fr&#333; hir husband, I would w&eacute;ene if she
could alledge none other cause, he maie lawfullie without anie displeasure to saint
Peter, take hir out of saint Peters church by the arme. And if no bodie maie be
taken out of sanctuarie, that saith h&eacute;e will bide there: then if a child will take sanctuarie,
bicause he feareth to go to schoole, his maister must let him alone. And as
simple as that sample is, yet is there lesse reason in our case than in that; for therein,
though it be a childish feare, yet is there at the leastwise some feare, and herein is
there none at all. And verelie, I haue often heard of sanctuarie men, but I neuer
heard earst of sanctuarie children.</p>

<p>And therefore, as for the conclusion of my mind, who so maie haue deserued to
n&eacute;ed it, if they thinke it for their suertie, let them k&eacute;epe it. But he can be no sanctuarie
man, that neither hath wisdome to desire it, nor malice to deserue it; whose
life or libertie can by no lawfull processe stand in ieopardie. And he that taketh one
out of sanctuarie to doo him good, I saie plainlie, that he breaketh no sanctuarie.
When the duke had doone, the temporall men whole, and a good part of the spirituall
also, thinking no hurt earthlie meant toward the yoong babe, condescended in effect,
that if he were not deliuered, he should be fetched. Howbeit they thought it all best
in the auoiding of all maner of rumor, that the lord cardinall should first assaie to
get him with hir good will.</p>

<p>Wherevpon all the councell came vnto the Star-chamber at Westminster; and
the lord cardinall, leauing the protector with the councell in the Star-chamber, departed
into the sanctuarie to the qu&eacute;ene, with diuers other lords with him: were it for the
respect of his honor, or that she should by presence of so manie perceiue, that this
errand was not one mans mind: or were it, for that the protector intended not in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
matter to trust anie one man alone; or else, that if she finallie were determined to
k&eacute;epe him, some of that companie had happilie secret instruction, incontinent (mauger
hir mind) to take him, and to leaue hir no respit to conueie him, which she was
likelie to mind after this matter broken to hir, if hir time would in anie wise serue
hir.</p>

<p>When the qu&eacute;ene and these lords were come togither in presence, the lord cardinall
shewed vnto hir, that it was thought vnto the protector, and vnto the whole councell
that hir k&eacute;eping of the kings brother in that place, was the thing which highlie sounded,
hot onelie to the great rumor of the people and their obloquie; but also to the
importable gr&eacute;efe and displeasure of the kings roiall maiestie, to whose grace it
were as singular a comfort, to haue his naturall brother in companie, as it was their
both dishonour, and all theirs and hirs also, to suffer him in sanctuarie, as though the
one brother stood in danger and perill of the other [and therefore more conuenient it
were they should be togither, than parted asunder; that the world may well thinke
and saie both of their kinred and also of them, when they shall s&eacute;e and heare how
they k&eacute;epe continual companie, and liue in mutuall amitie (as becometh brethren)
which bringeth commodities with it, for number, infinite; and for vse, comfortable
and necessarie; as it is truelie said:</p>

<span class="i0">O quales fructus vtilitatis habet!]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Protector.</div>

<p>The cardinall shewed hir likewise, that the councell therefore had sent him vnto hir
to require hir the deliuerie of him, that he might be brought vnto the kings presence
at his libertie, out of that place, which they reckoned as a prison; and there should
he be demeaned according to his estate: and she in this dooing, should both doo
great good to the realme, pleasure to the councell, and profit to hir selfe, succour to
hir fr&eacute;ends that were in distresse, and ouer that (which he wist well she speciallie
tendered) not onelie great comfort and honor to the king, but also to the yoong
duke himselfe, whose both great wealth it were to be togither, as well for manie
greater causes, as also for their both disport &amp; recreation. Which thing the lord
est&eacute;emed no slight, though it s&eacute;eme light, well pondering that their youth without
recreation and plaie cannot indure; nor anie stranger, for the conuenience of both
their ages and estates, so m&eacute;etlie in that point for anie of them, as either of them for
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes answer.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;ene is loth to part with her son.</div>

<p>My lord (quoth the qu&eacute;ene) I saie not naie, but that it were verie conuenient, that
this gentleman, whome y&eacute;e require, were in companie of the king his brother: and
in good faith, me thinketh it were as great commoditie to them both, as for yet a while
to b&eacute;ene in the custodie of their mother, the tender age considered of the elder of
them both, but speciallie the yoonger, which (besides his infancie, that also n&eacute;edeth
good looking to) hath a while b&eacute;ene so sore diseased, vexed with sicknesse, and is so
newlie rather a little amended, than well recouered, that I dare put no person earthlie
in trust with his k&eacute;eping, but my selfe onelie, considering that there is (as physicians
saie) and as we also find, double the perill in the recidiuation, than was in the first
sicknesse, with which disease nature being sore laboured, forewearied and weakened
waxeth the lesse able to beare out and susteine a new surfet. And albeit there might
be founden other that would happilie doo their best vnto him, yet is there none that
either knoweth better how to order him, than I that so long haue kept him: or is
more tenderlie like to cherish him, than his owne mother that bare him.</p>

<p>No man denieth, good madame (quoth the cardinall) but that your grace were of all
folke most necessarie about your children: and so would all the councell not onelie be
content, but glad that ye were (if it might stand with your pleasure) to be in such
place as might stand with their honour. But if you doo appoint your selfe to tarrie
h&eacute;ere, then thinke they it more conuenient that the duke of Yorke were with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
king honourablie at his libertie, to the comfort of them both: than h&eacute;ere as a sanctuarie
man, to their both dishonour and obloquie, sith there is not alwaie so great necessitie
to haue the child to be with the mother: but that occasion may sometime be such,
that it should be more expedient to k&eacute;epe him elsewhere. Which in this well appeareth,
that at such time as your d&eacute;erest sonne then prince, and now king, should
for his honor, and good order of the countrie, k&eacute;epe houshold in Wales, farre out of
your companie: your grace was well content therewith your selfe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes mistrust of the lord protector.</div>

<p>Not verie well content (quoth the qu&eacute;ene) and yet the case is not like, for the tone
was then in health, and the tother is now sicke. In which case, I maruell greatlie,
that my lord protector is so desirous to haue him in his k&eacute;eping, where if the child in
his sicknesse miscarried by nature, yet might he run into slander and suspicion of
fraud. And where they call it a thing so sore against my childes honor, and theirs
also, that he bideth in this place: it is all their honours there to suffer him bide,
where no man doubteth he shall be best kept; and that is h&eacute;ere, while I am h&eacute;ere,
which as yet intend not to come foorth and ieopard my selfe after other of my fr&eacute;ends,
which would God were rather h&eacute;ere in suertie with me, than I were there in ieopardie
with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Howard, saith <i>Edw. Hall</i>.</div>

<p>Whie madame (quoth another lord) know you anie thing whie they should be in
ieopardie? Naie verelie sir (quoth sh&eacute;e) nor whie they should be in prison neither, as
they now be. But it is (I trow) no great maruell though I feare, least those that haue
not letted to put them in duresse without colour, will let as little to procure their
destruction without cause. The cardinall made a countenance to the other lord, that
he should harpe no more vpon that string; and then said he to the qu&eacute;ene, that he
nothing doubted, but that those lords of hir honorable kin, which as yet remained
vnder arrest, should vpon the matter examined, doo well inough: and as toward hir
noble person, neither was nor could be anie maner ieopardie.</p>

<p>Whereby should I trust that (quoth the qu&eacute;ene) in that I am giltlesse? As though
they were giltie, in that I am with their enimies better loued than they? When they
hate them for my sake, in that I am so n&eacute;ere of kin to the king? And how far they be
off, if that would helpe, as God send grace it hurt not, and therefore as for me, I
purpose not as yet to depart hence. And as for this gentleman my sonne, I mind that
he shall be where I am, till I s&eacute;e further: for I assure you, for that I s&eacute;e some men
so greedie, without anie substantiall cause to haue him, this maketh me much the
more fearder to deliuer him.</p>

<p>Truelie madame, quoth he, and the fearder that you be to deliuer him, the fearder
bin other men to suffer you to k&eacute;epe him, least your causelesse feare might cause you
further to conueie him; and manie be there that thinke he can haue no priuilege in this
place, which neither can haue will to aske it, nor malice to deserue it. And therefore,
they reckon no priuilege broken, though they fetch him out; which if y&eacute;e finallie
refuse to deliuer him, I verelie thinke they will. So much dread hath my lord his
vncle, for the tender loue he beareth him, least your grace should hap to send him
awaie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The qu&eacute;enes replie vpon the lord cardinall.</div>

<p>A sir (quoth the qu&eacute;ene) hath the protector so tender zeale, that he feareth nothing
but least he should escape him? Thinketh he that I would send him hence, which
neither is in the plight to send out. And in what place could I reckon him sure, if
he be not sure in this sanctuarie, whereof was there neuer tyrant yet so diuelish that
durst presume to breake? And I trust God is as strong now to withstand his aduersaries
as euer he was. But my sonne can deserue no sanctuarie, and therefore he can not
haue it. Forsooth he hath found a goodlie glose, by which that place that may defend
a th&eacute;efe, may not saue an innocent. But he is in no ieopardie, nor hath no n&eacute;ed thereof,
would God he had not.</p>

<p>Troweth the protector (I praie God he may prooue a protector) troweth he that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
perceiue not wherevnto his painted processe draweth? It is not honourable that the
duke bide h&eacute;ere: it were comfortable for them both, that he were with his brother, bicause
the king lacketh a plaifellow. Be you sure? I praie God send them both better
plaifellowes than him, that maketh so high a matter vpon such a trifling pretext: as
though there could none be founden to plaie with the king, but if his brother that
hath no lust to plaie for sicknesse, come out of sanctuarie out of his safegard to plaie
with him. As though princes (as yoong as they be) could not plaie but with their
p&eacute;eres, or children could not plaie but with their kinred, with whome for the more
part they agr&eacute;e much woorse than with strangers.</p>

<p>But the child cannot require the priuilege. Who told him so? He shall heare him
aske it, and he will. Howbeit, this is a gaie matter. Suppose he could not aske it,
suppose he would not aske it, suppose he would aske to go out. If I saie he shall not;
if I aske the priuilege but for my selfe, I say he that against my will taketh him out,
breaketh the sanctuarie. Serueth this libertie for my person onelie, or for my goods
too? Y&eacute;e may not hence take my horsse fro me: and may you take my child fro me?
He is also my ward: for as my learned councell sheweth me, sith he hath nothing by
descent holden by knights seruice, the law maketh his mother his gardian. Then
may no man I suppose take my ward fro me out of sanctuarie, without the breach of
the sanctuarie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This that is h&eacute;ere betw&eacute;ene this marke (*) &amp; this marke (*) was not writt&#275; by him in English but is translated out of this historie which he wrote in Latine.</div>

<p>And if my priuilege could not serue him, nor he aske it for himselfe, yet sith the
law committeth to me the custodie of him, I may require it for him, except the law
giue a child a gardian onelie for his goods and lands, discharging him of the cure and
safe k&eacute;eping of his bodie, for which onelie both lands and goods serue. (*) And if
examples be sufficient to obteine priuilege for my child, I n&eacute;ed not farre to s&eacute;eke. For
in this place in which we now be (and which is now in question whether my child
may take benefit of it) mine other sonne now king was borne, and kept in his cradle
and preserued to a more prosperous fortune, which I praie God long to continue.
And as all you know, this is not the first time that I haue taken sanctuarie.</p>

<p>For when my lord my husband was banished, and thrust out of his kingdome, I
fled hither, being great with child, and h&eacute;ere I bare the prince. And when my lord
my husband returned safe againe, and had the victorie, then went I hence to welcome
him home, and from hence I brought my babe the prince vnto his father, when he
first tooke him in his armes. And I praie God that my sonnes palace may be as great
safegard vnto him now reigning, as this place was sometime to the kings enimie. In
which place I intend to k&eacute;epe his brother, sith, &amp;c. (*) Wherefore h&eacute;ere intend I to
k&eacute;epe him, sith mans law serueth the gardian to k&eacute;epe the infant.</p>

<p>The law of nature will the mother to k&eacute;epe hir child, God's law priuilegeth the
sanctuarie, and the sanctuarie my sonne, sith I feare to put him in the protectors
hands that hath his brother alreadie, and were (if both failed) inheritor to the crowne.
The cause of my feare hath no man to doo to examine. And yet feare I no further
than the law feareth, which (as learned men tell me) forbiddeth euerie man the custodie
of them, by whose death he maie inherit lesse land than a kingdome. I can no more
but whosoeuer he be that breaketh this holie sanctuarie, I praie God shortlie send him
n&eacute;ed of sanctuarie, when he maie not come to it. For taken out of sanctuarie would I
not my mortall enimie were.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord cardinall vseth an other waie to persuade the qu&eacute;ene.</div>

<p>The lord cardinall, perceiuing that the qu&eacute;ene waxed euer the longer the farther off,
and also that she began to kindle and chafe, and spake more biting words against the
protector, and such as he neither bel&eacute;eued, and was also loth to heare, he said to hir
for a finall conclusion, that he would no longer dispute the matter: but if she were
content to deliuer the duke to him, and to the other lords present, he durst laie his
owne bodie &amp; soule both in pledge, not onelie for his suertie, but also for his estate.
And if she would giue them a resolute answer to the contrarie, he would foorthwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
depart therewithall, and shift who so would with this businesse afterwards: for he neuer
intended more to mooue hir in that matter, in which she thought that he &amp; all other
also (saue hir selfe) lacked either wit or truth: wit, if they were so dull that they
could nothing perceiue what the protector intended: truth, if they should procure
hir sonne to be deliuered into his hands, in whom they should perceiue toward the
child anie euill intended.</p>

<p>The qu&eacute;ene with these words stood a good while in a great studie. And forsomuch as
hir s&eacute;emed the cardinall more readie to depart than some of the remnant, and the protector
himselfe readie at hand; so that she verelie thought she could not k&eacute;epe him, but
that he should incontinentlie be taken thense: and so conueie him elsewhere, neither had
she time to serue hir, nor place determined, nor persons appointed, all things vnreadie,
this message came on hir so suddenlie, nothing lesse looking for than to haue him fet
out of sanctuarie, which she thought to be now beset in such places about, that he
could not be conueied out vntaken, and partlie as she thought it might fortune hir
feare to be false, so well she wist it was either n&eacute;edlesse or bootlesse: wherefore if she
should n&eacute;eds go from him, she d&eacute;emed it best to deliuer him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">She falleth to a resolution touching hir sonnes deliuerie.</div>

<p>And ouer that, of the cardinals faith she nothing doubted, nor of some other lords
neither, whome she there saw. Which as she feared least they might be deceiued: so
was she well assured they would not be corrupted. Then thought she it should yet
make them the more warilie to looke to him, and the more circumspectlie to s&eacute;e to his
suertie, if she with hir owne hands betooke him to them of trust. And at the last
she tooke the yoong duke by the hand, and said vnto the lords: My lords (quoth she)
and all my lords, I neither am so vnwise to mistrust your wits, nor so suspicious to
mistrust your truths: of which thing I purpose to make you such a proofe, as if either
of both in you, might turne both you and me to great sorow, the realme to much
harme, and you to great reproch.</p>

<p>For lo, here is (quoth she) this gentleman, whom I doubt not but I could here k&eacute;epe
safe, if I would, what euer anie man say: &amp; I doubt not also, but there be some abroad
so deadlie enimies vnto my bloud, that if they wist where anie of it laie in their owne
bodie, they would let it out. We haue also experience that desire of a kingdome
knoweth no kinred. The brother hath b&eacute;ene the brothers bane: and maie the nephues
be sure of their vncle? Ech of these children is the others defense while they
be asunder, and ech of their liues lieth in the others bodie. K&eacute;epe one safe and both
be sure, and nothing for them both more perillous, than to be both in one place. For
what wise merchant aduentureth all his goods in one ship?</p>

<p>All this notwithstanding, here I deliuer him and his brother in him, to k&eacute;epe, into
your hands, of whom I shall aske them both afore God &amp; the world. Faithfull
ye be that wot I well, &amp; I know well you be wise. Power and strength to k&eacute;epe
him (if you list) lacke ye not of your selfe, nor can lacke helpe in this cause. And
if ye can not elsewhere, then maie you leaue him here. But onelie one thing I bes&eacute;ech
you, for the trust which his father put in you euer, &amp; for the trust that I put in
you now, that as farre as ye thinke that I feare too much, be you well ware that you
feare not as farre too little. And therewithall she said vnto the child: Fare well mine
owne sweete sonne, God send you good k&eacute;eping: let me kisse you yet once yer you
go, for God knoweth when we shall kisse togither againe. And therewith she kissed
him and blessed him, turned hir backe and wept and went hir waie, leauing the child
w&eacute;eping as fast. [Howbeit she was sorie afterwards that she had so parted from hir
son (when it was past hir power to procure remedie, &amp; no hope of helpe left against
afterclaps) which is the common case of all that kind, as the prouerbe saith:</p>

<span class="i0">Femineus ver&egrave; dolor est post facta dolere.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">O dissimulation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">This that is here betw&eacute;ene this marke (*) &amp; this marke (*) was not written by him in English but is translated out of his historie which he wrote in Latine.</div>

<p>When the lord cardinall, and these other lords with him, had receiued this yoong
duke, they brought him into the Star-chamber, where the protector tooke him in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
armes and kissed him with these words: Now welcome my lord euen with all my
verie heart. And he said in that of likelihood as he thought. Therevpon foorthwith
they brought him vnto the king his brother into the bishops palace at Paules, and
from thense thorough the citie honourablie into the Tower, out of the which after that
daie they neuer came abroad. (*) When the protector had both the children in his
hands, he opened himselfe more boldlie, both to certeine other men, and also cheeflie
to the duke of Buckingham. Although I know that manie thought that this duke
was priuie to all the protectors counsell, euen from the beginning; and some of the
protectors fr&eacute;ends said, that the duke was the first moouer of the protector to this
matter, sending a priuie messenger vnto him, streict after king Edwards death.</p>

<p>But others againe, which knew better the subtill wit of the protector, denie that he
euer opened his enterprise to the duke, vntill he had brought to passe the things before
rehearsed. But when he had imprisoned the qu&eacute;enes kinsfolks, &amp; gotten both
his sonnes into his owne hands, then he opened the rest of his purpose with lesse
feare to them whome he thought m&eacute;et for the matter, and speciallie to the duke, who
being woone to his purpose, he thought his strength more than halfe increased. The
matter was broken vnto the duke by subtill folks, and such as were their craftes-masters
in the handling of such wicked deuises: who declared vnto him that the yoong
king was offended with him for his kinsfolks sake, and if he were euer able he would
reuenge them, who would pricke him forward therevnto if they escaped (for they
would remember their imprisonment) or else it they were put to death, without doubt
the yoong K. would be carefull for their deaths, whose imprisonment was gr&eacute;euous
vnto him.</p>

<p>Also that with repenting the duke should nothing auaile, for there was no waie left
to red&eacute;eme his offense by benefits, but he should sooner destroie himselfe than saue
the king, who with his brother and his kinsfolks he saw in such places imprisoned, as
the protector might with a becke destroie them all: and that it were no doubt but
he would doo it in d&eacute;ed, if there were anie new enterprise attempted. And that it
was likelie, that as the protector had prouided priuie gard for himselfe, so had he
spials for the duke, and traines to catch him, if he should be against him; and that
peraduenture from them, whome he lest suspected. For the state of things and the
dispositions of men were then such, that a man could not well tell whome he might
trust, or whom he might feare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dukes full resolution, to go thorough with his enterprise.</div>

<p>These things and such like, being beaten into the dukes mind, brought him to that
point, that where he had repented the way that he had entered; yet would he go
foorth in the same; and sith he had once begun, he would stoutlie go thorough. And
therefore to this wicked enterprise, which he bel&eacute;eued could not be voided, he bent
himselfe, and went through; and determined, that sith the common misch&eacute;efe could
not be amended, he would turne it as much as he might to his owne commoditie.
Then it was agr&eacute;ed, that the protector shuld haue the dukes aid to make him king,
and that the protectors onelie lawfull sonne should marrie the dukes daughter, and
that the protector should grant him the quiet possession of the earldome of Hereford,
which he claimed as his inheritance, and could neuer obteine it in king Edwards
time.</p>

<p>Besides these requests of the duke, the protector of his owne mind promised him a
great quantitie of the kings treasure, and of his houshold stuffe. And when they
were thus at a point betw&eacute;ene themselues, they went about to prepare for the coronation
of the yoong king, as they would haue it s&eacute;eme. And that they might turne
both the eies and minds of men from perceiuing of their drifts other-where, the lords
being sent for from all parts of the realme, came thicke to that solemnitie. But the
protector and the duke, after that they had sent the lord cardinall, the archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
Yorke then lord chancellor, the bishop of Elie, the lord Stanleie, and the lord Hastings
then lord chamberlaine, with manie other noble men (*) to common &amp; deuise
about the coronation in one place, as fast were they in an other place, contriuing the
contrarie, and to make the protector king.</p>

<p>To which councell albeit there were adhibited verie few, and they were secret:
yet began there here and there abouts, some maner of muttering among the people, as
though all should not long be well, though they neither wist what they feared, nor
wherefore: were it, that before such great things, mens hearts of a secret instinct of
nature misgiue them; as the sea without wind swelleth of himselfe sometime before a
tempest: or were it that some one man, happilie somewhat perceiuing, filled manie
men with suspicion, though he shewed few men what he knew. Howbeit somewhat
the dealing it selfe made men to muse on the matter, though the councell were close.
For by little and little all folke withdrew from the Tower, and drew vnto Crosbies in
Bishops gates str&eacute;et, where the protector kept his houshold. The protector had the
resort, the king in maner desolate.</p>

<p>While some for their businesse made sute to them that had the dooing, some were
by their fr&eacute;ends secretlie warned, that it might happilie turne them to no good, to be
too much attendant about the king without the protectors appointment, which remooued
also diuerse of the princes old seruants from him, and set new about him.
Thus manie things comming togither, partlie by chance, partlie of purpose, caused
at length not common people onelie, that woond with the wind, but wise men also,
and some lords eke to marke the matter and muse thereon; so farre foorth that
the lord Stanleie that was after earle of Derbie, wiselie mistrusted it, and said vnto
the lord Hastings, that he much misliked these two seuerall counccels. For while we
(quoth he) talke of one matter in the tone place, little wot we wherof they talke in
the tother place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Catesbie and his conditions described.</div>

<p>My lord (quoth the lord Hastings) on my life neuer doubt you: for while one
man is there, which is neuer thense, neuer can there be thing once mooued, that
should sound amisse toward me, but it should be in mine eares yer it were well out of
their mouths. This ment he by Catesbie, which was of his n&eacute;ere secret councell, and
whome he verie familiarlie vsed, and in his most weightie matters put no man in so
speciall trust, reckoning himselfe to no man so liefe, sith he well wist there was no
man so much to him beholden as was this Catesbie, which was a man well learned in
the lawes of this land, and by the speciall fauour of the lord chamberlaine, in good
authoritie, and much rule bare in all the countie of Leicester, where the lord chamberlains
power cheeflie laie.</p>

<p>But suerlie great pitie was it, that he had not had either more truth, or lesse wit.
For his dissimulation onelie kept all that misch&eacute;efe vp. In whome if the lord Hastings
had not put so speciall trust, the lord Stanleie &amp; he had departed with diuerse
other lords, and broken all the danse, for manie ill signs that he saw, which he now
construes all to the best. So suerlie thought he, that there could be none harme toward
him in that councell intended, where Catesbie was. And of truth the protector
and the duke of Buckingham made verie good semblance vnto the lord Hastings, and
kept him much in companie. And vndoubtedlie the protector loued him well, and
loth was to haue lost him, sauing for feare least his life should haue quailed their
purpose.</p>

<p>For which cause he mooued Catesbie to prooue with some words cast out a farre off,
whether he could thinke it possible to win the lord Hastings vnto their part. But
Catesbie, whether he assaied him, or assaied him not, reported vnto them, that he
found him so fast, and heard him speake so terrible words, that he durst no further
breake. And of truth, the lord chamberlaine of verie trust shewed vnto Catesbie
the distrust that others began to haue in the matter. And therefore he, fearing least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
their motion might with the lord Hastings minish his credence, wherevnto onelie all
the matter leaned, procured the protector hastilie to rid him. And much the rather,
for that he trusted by his death to obteine much of the rule that the lord Hastings
bare in his countrie: the onelie desire whereof was the allectiue that induced him to
be partner, and one speciall contriuer of all this horrible treason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An assemblie of lords in the Tower.</div>

<p>Wherevpon soone after, that is to wit, on the fridaie [being the thirt&eacute;enth of Iune]
manie lords assembled in the Tower, and there sat in councell, deuising the honourable
solemnitie of the kings coronation, of which the time appointed then so n&eacute;ere
approched, that the pageants and subtilties were in making daie &amp; night at Westminster,
and much vittels killed therfore, that afterward was cast awaie. These lords
so sitting togither communing of this matter, the protector came in amongst them,
first about nine of the clocke, saluting them courteouslie, and excusing himselfe that
he had b&eacute;ene from them so long, saieng merilie that he had b&eacute;ene a sl&eacute;eper that
daie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The behauior of the lord protector in the assemblie of the lords.</div>

<p>After a little talking with them, he said vnto the bishop of Elie; My lord you haue
verie good strawberies at your garden in Holborne, I require you let vs haue a messe
of them. Gladlie my lord (quoth he) would God I had some better thing as readie
to your pleasure as that! And therewithall in all the hast he sent his seruant for a
messe of strawberies. The protector set the lords fast in communing, and therevpon
praieng them to spare him for a little while, departed thense. And soone after one
houre, betw&eacute;ene ten &amp; eleuen he returned into the chamber amongst them all, changed
with a woonderfull soure angrie countenance, knitting the browes, frowning and fretting,
and gnawing on his lips: and so sat him downe in his place.</p>

<p>All the lords were much dismaid and sore maruelled at this maner of sudden change,
and what thing should him aile. Then, when he had sitten still a while, thus he began:
What were they worthie to haue that compasse and imagine the destruction of
me, being so n&eacute;ere of bloud vnto the king, and protector of his roiall person and his
realme? At this question, all the lords sat sore astonied, musing much by whome this
question should be meant, of which euerie man wist himselfe cl&eacute;ere. Then the lord
chamberlaine (as he that for the loue betw&eacute;ene them thought he might be boldest with
him) answered and said, that they were worthie to be punished as heinous traitors, whatsoeuer
they were. And all the other affirmed the same. That is (quoth he) yonder
sorceresse my brothers wife, and other with hir (meaning the qu&eacute;ene.)</p>

<p>At these words manie of the other lords were greatlie abashed, that fauoured hir.
But the lord Hastings was in his mind better content, that it was mooued by hir, than
by anie other whome he loued better: albeit his heart somewhat grudged, that he was
not afore made of counsell in this matter, as he was of the taking of hir kinred, and
of their putting to death, which were by his assent before deuised to be beheaded at
Pomfret this selfe same daie, in which he was not ware that it was by other deuised,
that he himselfe should be beheaded the same daie at London. Then said the protector:
Ye shall all s&eacute;e in what wise that sorceresse, and that other witch of hir counsell
Shores wife, with their affinitie, haue by their sorcerie and witchcraft wasted my
bodie. And therwith he plucked vp his dublet sl&eacute;eue to his elbow vpon his left arme,
where he shewed a weerish withered arme, and small; as it was neuer other.</p>

<p>Herevpon euerie mans mind sore misgaue them, well perceiuing that this matter was
but a quarrell. For they well wist that the qu&eacute;ene was too wise to go about anie such
follie. And also if she would, yet would she of all folke least, make Shores wife of
hir counsell, whome of all women she most hated, as that concubine whome the king
hir husband had most loued. And also, no man was there present, but well knew that
his arme was euer such since his birth. Nathelesse, the lord chamberlaine (which
from the death of king Edward kept Shores wife, on whome he somewhat doted in the
kings life, sauing (as it is said) he that while forbare hir of reuerence toward the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
else of a certeine kind of fidelitie to his fr&eacute;end) answered and said: Certeinelie my
lord, if they haue so heinouslie doone, they be worthie heinous punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleie wounded.</div>

<p>What (quoth the protector) thou seruest me I w&eacute;ene with ifs and with ands, I tell
th&eacute;e they haue so doone, and that I will make good on thy bodie traitor: and therewith
as in a great anger, he clapped his fist vpon the boord a great rap. At which
token one cried, Treason, without the chamber. Therewith a doore clapped, and in
come there rushing men in harnesse, as manie as the chamber might hold. And anon
the protector said to the lord Hastings: I arrest th&eacute;e traitor: What me my lord?
(quoth he.) Yea th&eacute;e traitor quoth the protector. And an other let flie at the lord
Stanleie, which shrunke at the stroke, &amp; fell vnder the table, or else his head had b&eacute;ene
cleft to the t&eacute;eth: for as shortlie as he shranke, yet ran the bloud about his eares.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Hastings lord chamberleine beheaded.</div>

<p>Then were they all quickelie bestowed in diuerse chambers, except the lord chamberleine,
whome the protector bad sp&eacute;ed and shriue him apace, for by saint Paule (quoth
he) I will not to dinner till I s&eacute;e thy head off. It booted him not to aske whie, but
heauilie tooke a priest at aduenture, &amp; made a short shrift: for a longer would not be
suffered, the protector made so much hast to dinner, which he might not go to, vntill
this were doone, for sauing of his oth. So was he brought foorth to the gr&eacute;ene beside
the chappell within the Tower, and his head laid downe vpon a long log of timber,
and there striken off, and afterward his bodie with the head interred at Windsor
beside the bodie of king Edward, both whose soules our Lord pardon. [Thus began
he to establish his kingdome in bloud, growing thereby in hatred of the nobles, and
also abridging both the line of his life, and the time of his regiment: for God will not
haue bloudthirstie tyrants daies prolonged, but will cut them off in their ruffe; according

<div class="sidenote">The lord Stanleie's dreame.</div>

<p>A maruellous case is it to heare either the warnings of that he should haue voided,
or the tokens of that he could not void. For the selfe night next before his death,
the lord Stanleie sent a trustie messenger vnto him at midnight in all the hast, requiring
him to rise and ride awaie with him, for he was disposed vtterlie no longer to
bide, he had so fearfull a dreame; in which him thought that a boare with his tuskes
so rased them both by the heads, that the bloud ran about both their shoulders. And
forsomuch as the protector gaue the boare for his cognisance, this dreame made so fearfull
an impression in his heart, that he was throughlie determined no longer to tarrie,

feare fantasieth, or doo rise in the nights rest by reason of his daies thought? Tell him
it is plaine witchcraft to bel&eacute;eue in such dreames, which if they were tokens of things
to come, why thinketh he not that we might be as likelie to make them true by our
going, if we were caught &amp; brought backe, as fr&eacute;ends faile fliers; for then had the
boare a cause likelie to rase vs with his tusks, as folke that fled for some falsehood.
Wherefore, either is there perill, or none there is in d&eacute;ed: or if anie be, it is rather
in going than biding. And in case we should n&eacute;eds fall in perill one waie or other,
yet had I rather that men should s&eacute;e that it were by other mens falsehood, than thinke
it were either by our owne fault, or faint heart. And therefore go to thy maister
(man) and commend me to him, &amp; praie him be merrie &amp; haue no feare: for I insure
him I am as sure of the man that he woteth of, as I am of mine owne hand. God
send grace sir (quoth the messenger) and went his waie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foretokens of imminent misfortune to the lord Hastings.</div>

<p>Certeine is it also, that in riding towards the Tower, the same morning in which he
was beheaded, his horsse twise or thrise stumbled with him, almost to the falling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
Which thing albeit ech man wote well dailie happeneth to them, to whom no such
mischance is toward; yet hath it b&eacute;ene of an old rite and custome obserued, as a token
oftentimes notablie foregoing some great misfortune. Now this that followeth was
no warning, but an enuious scorne. The same morning yer he was vp, came a knight
vnto him, as it were of courtesie, to accompanie him to the councell; but of truth
sent by the protector to hast him thitherwards, with whome he was of secret confederacie
in that purpose; a meane man at that time and now of great authoritie.</p>

<p>This knight (I say) when it happened the lord chamberleine by the waie to staie his
horsse, &amp; common a while with a priest whome he met in the Tower str&eacute;et, brake his
tale, and said merilie to him; What my lord, I pray you come on, whereto talke you so
long with that priest? you haue no n&eacute;ed of a priest yet: and therwith he laughed
vpon him, as though he would say, Ye shall haue soone. But so little wist the tother
what he ment, and so little mistrusted, that he was neuer merrier, nor neuer so full of
good hope in his life, which selfe thing is oft s&eacute;ene a signe of change. But I shall
rather let anie thing passe me, than the vaine suertie of mans mind so n&eacute;ere his death
[flattering himselfe with deceitfull conceipts of inward motions of life to be prolonged,
euen in present cases of deadlie danger, and heauie misfortunes offering great mistrust;
as he did that is noted for speaking like a foole:</p>

<p>Vpon the verie Tower wharfe, so n&eacute;ere the place where his head was off soone after,
there met he with one Hastings a purseuant of his owne name. And at their m&eacute;eting
in that place, he was put in remembrance of another time, in which it had happened
them before to m&eacute;et in like manner togither in the same place. At which other time
the lord chamberleine had b&eacute;ene accused vnto king Edward by the lord Riuers the
qu&eacute;enes brother, in such wise, as he was for the while (but it lasted not long) farre fallen
into the kings indignation, &amp; stood in great feare of himselfe. And forsomuch as he
now met this purseuant in the same place, that ieopardie so well passed, it gaue him
great pleasure to talke with him thereof, with whome he had before talked thereof
in the same place, while he was therein.</p>

<p>And therefore he said: Ha Hastings, art thou remembred when I met th&eacute;e here
once with an heauie heart? Yea my lord (quoth he) that remember I well, and thanked
be God, they gat no good, nor you no harme thereby. Thou wouldest say so
(quoth he) if thou knewest as much as I know, which few know else as yet, and mo
shall shortlie. That meant he by the lords of the qu&eacute;enes kinred that were taken
before, and should that daie be beheaded at Pomfret: which he well wist, but nothing
ware that the ax hung ouer his owne head. In faith man (quoth he) I was neuer so
sorie, nor neuer stood in so great dread in my life, as I did when thou and I met here.
And lo how the world is turned, now stand mine enimies in the danger (as thou maiest
hap to heare more hereafter) and I neuer in my life so merrie, nor neuer in so great
suertie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The description of the lord Hastings.</div>

<p>O good God, the blindnesse of our mortall nature, when he most feared, he was
in good suertie; when he reckoned himselfe surest, he lost his life, and that within
two houres after. Thus ended this honorable man, a good knight and a gentle, of
great authoritie with his prince, of liuing somewhat dissolute, plaine and open to his
enimie, &amp; secret to his friend, easie to beguile, as he that of good heart and courage
forestudied no perils, a louing man, and passing well beloued: verie faithfull, and
trustie inough, trusting too much. Now flew the fame of this lords death swiftlie
through the citie, and so foorth further about like a wind in euerie mans eare. But
the protector, immediatlie after dinner, intending to set some colour vpon the matter,
sent in all the hast for manie substantiall men out of the citie into the tower.</p>

<p>Now at their comming, himselfe with the duke of Buckingham, stood harnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
in old ill faring briganders, such as no man should w&eacute;ene, that they would vouchsafe
to haue put vpon their backs, except that some sudden necessitie had constreined
them. And then the protector shewed them, that the lord chamberleine, and other
of his conspiracie, had contriued to haue suddenlie destroied him, and the duke, there
the same day in the councell. And what they intended further, was as yet not well
knowne. Of which their treason he neuer had knowledge before ten of the clocke
the same forenoone, which sudden feare draue them to put on for their defense such
harnesse as came next to hand. And so had God holpen them, that the mischiefe
turned vpon them that would haue doone it. And this he required them to report.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The protectors proclamation.</div>

<p>Euerie man answered him faire, as though no man mistrusted the matter, which of
truth no man bel&eacute;eued. Yet for the further appeasing of the peoples minds, he sent
immediatlie after diner in all the hast one herald of armes, with a proclamation to be
made through the citie in the kings name, conteining, that the lord Hastings, with
diuerse other of his traitorous purposes, had before conspired the same day to haue
slaine the lord protector, and the duke of Buckingham sitting in the councell; and
after to haue taken vpon them to rule the king &amp; the realme at their pleasure, and
therby to pill and spoile whome they list vncontrolled. And much matter there was
in that proclamation, deuised to the slander of the lord chamberleine, as that he was
an ill councellor to the kings father, intising him to manie things highlie redounding
to the minishing of his honour, and to the vniuersall hurt of the realme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The life and d&eacute;eds of the lord chamberlaine laid open.</div>

<p>The meanes whereby; namelie, his euill companie, sinister procuring, and vngratious
example, as well in manie other things, as in the vicious liuing and inordinate
abusion of his bodie, with manie other, and also speciallie with Shores wife, which
was one also of his most secret counsell in this most heinous treason, with whome he
laie nightlie, and namelie the night last past next before his death. So that it was
the lesse maruell, if vngratious liuing brought him to an vnhappie ending, which he
was now put vnto by the most dread commandement of the kings highnesse, and of his
honorable and faithfull councell, both for his demerits, being so openlie taken in his
falslie conceiued treason, and also least the delaieng of his execution might haue incouraged
other mischiefous persons, partners of his conspiracie, to gather and assemble
themselues togither, in making some great commotion for his deliuerance: whose
hope being now by his well deserued death politikelie repressed, all the realme should
(by Gods grace) rest in good quiet and peace.</p>

<p>Now was this proclamation made within two houres after that he was beheaded, and
it was so curiouslie indicted, &amp; so faire written in parchment, in so well a set hand, and
therewith of it selfe so long a processe, that euerie child might well perceiue that it
was prepared before. For all the time, betw&eacute;ene his death and the proclaming,
could scant haue sufficed vnto the bare writing alone, all had it b&eacute;ene but in paper,
and scribled foorth in hast at aduenture. So that vpon the proclaming thereof, one
that was schoolemaister of Powles of chance standing by, and comparing the shortnesse
of the time with the length of the matter, said vnto them that stood about him;
Here is a gaie goodlie cast foule cast awaie for hast. And a merchant answered him,
that it was written by prophesie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shores wife spoiled of all that she had.</div>

<p>Now then by and by, as it were for anger, not for couetise, the protector sent into
the house of Shores wife (for hir husband dwelled not with hir) and spoiled hir of all
that euer she had, aboue the value of two or thr&eacute;e thousand markes, and sent hir
bodie to prison. And when he had a while laid vnto hir (for the maner sake) that
she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of counsell with the lord chamberleine
to destroie him: in conclusion, when that no colour could fasten vpon these
matters, then he laid heinouslie to hir charge, that thing that hir selfe could not denie,
and that all the world wist was true, and that nathelesse euerie man laughed at, to
heare it then so suddenlie so highlie taken, that sh&eacute;e was naught of hir bodie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shores wife put to open penance.</div>

<p>And for this cause (as a goodlie continent prince, cleane and faultlesse of himselfe,
sent out of heauen into this vicious world for the amendment of mens maners) he
caused the bishop of London to put hir to open penance, going before the crosse in
procession vpon a sundaie with a taper in hir hand. In which she went in countenance
and pase demure so womanlie; that albeit she were out of all araie, saue hir
kirtle onelie, yet went she so faire and louelie, namelie while the woondering of the
people cast a comelie rud in hir cheeks (of which she before had most misse) that hir
great shame wan hir much praise among those that were more amorous of hir bodie,
than curious of hir soule. And manie good folks also that hated hir liuing, &amp; glad
were to s&eacute;e sin corrected: yet pitied they more hir penance, than reioised therin, when
they considered that the protector procured it, more of a corrupt intent, than
anie vertuous affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The descripti&#333; of Shores wife.</div>

<p>This woman was borne in London, worshipfullie friended, honestlie brought vp, and
verie well maried, sauing somewhat too soone, hir husband an honest citizen, yoong
and goodlie, &amp; of good substance. But forsomuch as they were coupled yer she were
well ripe, she not verie feruentlie loued him, for wh&#333; she neuer longed, which was
happilie the thing that the more easilie made hir incline vnto the kings appetite, when
he required hir. Howbeit the respect of his roialtie, the hope of gaie apparell, ease,
and other wanton wealth, was able soone to pearse a soft tender heart, [so that she
became flexible and pliant to the kings appetite and will; being so blinded with the
bright glorie of the present courtlie brauerie which sh&eacute;e inioied, that she vtterlie
forgat how excellent a treasure good name and fame is, and of what incomparable
sweetnesse, euen by the iudgement of him, whose match for wisdome the world neuer
bred vp, saieng:</p>

<p>But when the king had abused hir, anon hir husband (as he was an honest man, and
one that could his good, not presuming to touch a kings concubine) left hir vp to him
altogither. When the king died, the lord chamberleine tooke hir, which in the kings
daies, albeit he was sore inamoured vpon hir, yet he forbare hir; ether for reuerence,
or for a certeine friendlie faithfulnesse. Proper she was and faire; nothing in hir bodie
that you would haue changed, but if ye would haue wished hir somewhat higher.
Thus saie they that knew hir in hir youth. Albeit some that now s&eacute;e hir (for yet<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
she liueth) deem hir neuer to haue b&eacute;ene well visaged: whose iudgement s&eacute;emeth me
somewhat like, as though men should gesse the beautie of one long before departed
by hir scalpe taken out of the charnell house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Edwards thr&eacute;e concubines.</div>

<p>For now is she old, leane, withered and dried vp, nothing left but riuelled skin
and hard bone. And yet being euen such, who so well aduise hir visage, might
gesse and deuise, which parts how filled would make it a faire face. Yet delighted
not men so much in hir beautie, as in hir pleasant behauiour. For a proper wit had
she, and could both read well and write, merrie in companie, readie and quicke of
answer, neither mute, nor full of bable, sometime tawnting without displeasure, and
not without disport. The king would saie that he had thr&eacute;e concubines, which in
thr&eacute;e diuerse properties diuerslie excelled. One the merriest, another the wiliest, the
third the holiest harlot in his realme, as one whome no man could get out of the church
lightlie to any place, but it were to his bed.</p>

<p>The other two were somewhat greater personages, and nathelesse of their humilitie
content to be namelesse, and to forbeare the praise of those properties: but the merriest
was this Shores wife, in whom the king therefore tooke speciall pleasure. For
manie he had, but hir he loued; whose fauour to say the truth (for sin it were to beelie
the diuell) she neuer abused to anie mans hurt, but to manie a mans comfort and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>rel&eacute;efe. Where the king tooke displeasure, sh&eacute;e would mitigate and appease his mind:
where men were out of fauour, she would bring them in his grace. For manie that
had highlie offended sh&eacute;e obteined pardon. Of great forfeitures she gat men remission.</p>

<p>Finallie, in manie weightie sutes she stood manie a man in great stead, either for
none or verie small rewards, and those rather gaie than rich; either that she was
content with the d&eacute;ed it selfe well doone; or for that she delighted to be sued vnto,
and to shew what she was able to doo with the king; or for that wanton women and
wealthie be not alwaies courteous. I doubt not some shall thinke this woman too
slight a thing to be written of, and set among the remembrances of great matters:
which they shall speciallie thinke, that happilie shall est&eacute;eme hir onelie by that they
now s&eacute;e hir.</p>

<p>But me s&eacute;emeth the chance so much the more worthie to be remembred, in how
much she is now in the more beggerlie condition, vnfr&eacute;ended and worne out of acquaintance,
after good substance, after as great fauour with the prince, after as great sute and
s&eacute;eking to with all those, that those daies had businesse to sp&eacute;ed; as manie other men
were in their times, which be now famous onelie by the infamie of their ill d&eacute;eds.
Hir dooings were not much lesse, albeit they be much lesse remembred, bicause they
were not so euill. For men vse if they haue an euill turne, to write it in marble: and
who so dooth vs a good turne, we write it in dust, which is not worst prooued by hir:
for at this daie she beggeth of manie at this daie liuing, that at this daie had
begged if she had not b&eacute;ene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Richard Ratcliffe.</div>

<p>Now was it so deuised by the protector and his councell, that the selfe daie, in
which the lord chamberleine was beheaded in the Tower of London, and about the
selfe same houre, was there (not without his assent) beheaded at Pomfret, the foreremembred
lords &amp; knights that were taken from the king at Northampton and
Stonie Stratford. Which thing was doone in the presence, and by the order of
sir Richard Ratcliffe knight, whose seruice the protector speciallie vsed in that councell,
and in the execution of such lawlesse enterprises, as a man that had b&eacute;ene long
secret with him, hauing experience of the world, and a shrewd wit, short &amp; rude in
sp&eacute;ech, rough and boisterous of behauiour, bold in mischiefe, as far from pitie as from
all feare of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Riuers &amp; other beheaded.</div>

<p>This knight bringing them out of the prison to the scaffold, and shewing to the
people about that they were traitors (not suffering them to declare &amp; speake their innocencie,
least their words might haue inclined men to pitie them, and to hate the protector
and his part) caused them hastilie, without iudgement, processe, or maner of
order to be beheaded, and without other earthlie gilt, but onelie that they were good
men, too true to the king, and too nigh to the qu&eacute;ene. Now when the lord chamberleine
&amp; these other lords and knights were thus beheaded, and rid out of the waie:
then thought the protector, that when men mused what the matter meant, while the
lords of the realme were about him out of their owne strengths, while no man wist
what to thinke, nor whom to trust, yer euer they should haue space to dispute and digest
the matter and make parties; it were best hastilie to pursue his purpose, and put
himselfe in possession of the crowne, yer men could haue time to deuise anie waie to
resist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Edmund Shaw maior of London.</div>

<p>But now was all the studie by what meanes this matter, being of it selfe so heinous,
might be first broken to the people, in such wise that it might be well taken. To this
councell they tooke diuerse, such as they thought m&eacute;etlie to be trusted, likelie to be
induced to that part, and able to stand them in st&eacute;ed either by power or policie.
Among whome they made of councell Edmund Shaw knight then maior of London,
which vpon trust of his owne aduancement, whereof he was of a proud heart highlie
desirous, should frame the citie to their appetite. Of spirituall men they tooke such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
as had wit, and were in authentic among the people for opinion of their learning, and
had no scrupulous conscience. Among these had they Iohn Shaw clearke brother to
the maior, and frier Penker, prouinciall of the Augustine friers both doctors of
diuinitie, both great preachers, both of more learning than vertue, of more fame than
learning. For they were before greatlie est&eacute;emed among the people: but after that
neuer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doct. Shaw.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Frier Penker.</div>

<p>Of these two the one had a sermon in praise of the protector before the coronation,
the other after, both so full of tedious flatterie, that no mans eares could abide them.
Penker in his sermon so lost his voice, that he was fame to leaue off, and come downe
in the midst. Doctor Shaw by his sermon lost his honestie, &amp; soone after his life, for
verie shame of the world, into which he durst neuer after come abroad. But the frier
forced for no shame, and so it harmed him the lesse. Howbeit some doubt, and
manie thinke, that Penker was not of counsell in the matter before the coronation,
but after the common maner fell to flatterie after: namelie sith his sermon was not incontinentlie
vpon it, but at saint Marie hospitall at the Easter after.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The chiefest deuise to depose the prince.</div>

<p>But certeine it is, that doctor Shaw was of counsell in the beginning, so farre
foorth that they determined that he should first breake the matter in a sermon at Paules
crosse, in which he should (by the authoritie of his preaching) incline the people to
the protectors ghostlie purpose. But now was all the labor and studie in the deuise of
some conuenient pretext, for which the people should be content to depose the prince,
and accept the protector for king. In which diuerse things they deuised. But the
ch&eacute;efe thing &amp; the weightiest of all that inuention rested in this, that they should
alledge bastardie, either in king Edward himselfe, or in his children, or both. So that
he should s&eacute;eme disabled to inherit the crowne, by the duke of Yorke, and the prince
by him.</p>

<p>To laie bastardie in king Edward, sounded openlie to the rebuke of the protectors
owne mother, which was mother to them both; for in that point could be no other
color, but to pretend that his owne mother was an adultresse, which notwithstanding,
to further this purpose he letted not. But neuerthelesse he would that point should
be lesse and more fauourablie handled: not euen fullie plaine and directlie, but that
the matter should be touched aslope craftilie, as though men spared in that point to
speake all the truth, for feare of his displeasure. But the other point concerning the
bastardie that they deuised to surmize in king Edwards children, that would he should
be openlie declared and inforced to the vttermost. The colour and pretext whereof
cannot be well perceiued, but if we first repeat you some things long before doone
about king Edwards mariage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S&eacute;e before <i>pag. 283</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dame Elizabeth Greie.</div>

<p>After that king Edward the fourth had deposed king Henrie the sixt, and was in
peaceable possession of the realme, determining himselfe to marie (as it was m&eacute;et both
for him selfe &amp; the realme) he sent ouer in ambassage the erle of Warwike, with other
noble men in his companie to Spaine, to treat &amp; conclude a mariage betw&eacute;ene K. Edward
&amp; the kings daughter of Spaine. In which thing the erle of Warwike found
the parties so toward &amp; willing, that he speedily (according to his instructions without
any difficultie) brought the matter to very good c&#333;clusion. Now hapned it, that in
the meane season there came to make a sute by petition to the king dame Elizabeth
Greie, which was after his qu&eacute;ene, at that time a widow, borne of noble bloud, by
hir mother, duches of Bedford, yer she maried the lord Wooduile, hir father.</p>

<p>Howbeit, this dame Elizabeth hir selfe, being in seruice with qu&eacute;ene Margaret,
wife vnto king Henrie the sixt, was maried vnto one [Iohn] Greie an esquier, whome
king Henrie made knight vpon the field that he had on [Barnet heath by saint Albons]
against king Edward. But litle while inioied he that knighthood: for he was at the
same field slaine. After which doone, and the earle of Warwike, being in his ambassage
about the afore remembred mariage, this poore ladie made humble sute vnto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
king, that she might be restored vnto such small lands as hir late husband had giuen
hir in iointure. Whome when the king beheld, and heard hir speake as she was both
faire and of a goodlie fauor, moderate of stature, well made and verie wise: he not
onelie pitied hir, but also waxed inamoured of hir. And taking hir afterward secretlie
aside, began to enter in talking more familiarlie. Whose appetite when she perceiued,
she vertuouslie denied him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A wise answer of a chast and continent ladie.</div>

<p>But that did she so wiselie, and with so good maner, and words so well set, that she
rather kindled his desire than quenched it. And finallie, after manie a m&eacute;eting, much
wooing, and many great promises, she well espieng the kings affection toward hir so
greatlie increased, that she durst somewhat the more boldlie saie hir mind, as to him
whose hart she perceiued more feruentlie set, than to fall off for a word. And in conclusion,
she shewed him plaine, that as she wist hir selfe too simple to be his wife, so
thought she hir selfe too good to be his concubine. The king much maruelling at hir
constancie (as he that had not b&eacute;en woont elsewhere to be so stiffelie said naie) so much
est&eacute;emed hir continencie and chastitie, that he set hir vertue in the st&eacute;ed of possession
and riches: and thus taking counsell of his desire, determined in all possible hast
to marie hir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings mother.</div>

<p>Now after he was thus appointed, and had betw&eacute;ene them twaine insured hir: then
asked he counsell of his other fr&eacute;ends, and that in such maner, as they might then
perceiue it booted not greatlie to say naie. Notwithstanding the duches of Yorke
his mother was so sore mooued therewith, that she dissuaded the mariage as much as
she possible might; alledging that it was his honour, profit and suertie also, to marie
in a noble progenie out of his realme, wherevpon depended great strength to his estate,
by the affinitie and great possibilitie of increase of his possession. And that he could
not well otherwise doo, s&eacute;eing that the earle of Warwike had so farre mooued alreadie:
which were not likelie to take it well, if all his voiage were in such wise frustrate, and
his appointment deluded. And she said also, that it was not princelie to marie his
owne subiect, no great occasion leading therevnto, no possessions, or other commodities
depending therevpon; but onlie as it were a rich man that would marie his maid,
onelie for a little wanton dotage vpon hir person.</p>

<p>In which mariage manie mo commend the maidens fortune, than the maisters wisedome.
And yet therein (she said) was more honestie than honour in this mariage.
For somuch as there is betw&eacute;ene no merchant and his owne maid so great difference,
as betw&eacute;ene the king and this widow. In whose person, albeit there was nothing to
be misliked; yet was there (she said) nothing so excellent, but that it might be
found in diuerse other that were more m&eacute;etlie (quoth she) for your estate, and maidens
also; whereas the onelie widowhead of Elizabeth Greie, though she were in all other
things conuenient for you, shuld yet suffice (as me s&eacute;emeth) to refraine you from hir
mariage, sith it is an vnfitting thing, and a verie blemish and high disparagement to the
sacred maiestie of a prince, that ought as nigh to approch priesthood in cleannesse
as he dooth in dignitie, to be defiled with bigamie in his first mariage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings answer to his mother.</div>

<p>The king, when his mother had said, made hir answer, part in earnest, part in plaie
merilie, as he that wist himselfe out of hir rule. And albeit he would gladlie that she
should take it well, yet was at a point in his owne mind, tooke she it well or otherwise.
Howbeit somewhat to satisfie hir, he said, that albeit mariage (being a spirituall
thing) ought rather to be made for the respect of God, where his grace inclineth the
parties to loue togither, as he trusted it was in his, than for the regard of anie temporall
aduantage: yet neuerthelesse, him s&eacute;emed that this mariage, euen worldlie considered,
was not vnprofitable. For he reckoned the amitie of no earthlie nation so necessarie
for him, as the fr&eacute;endship of his owne, which he thought likely to beare him
so much the more hartie fauour, in that he disdained not to marie with one of his
owne land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet if outward aliance were thought so requisite, he would find the meanes
to enter thereinto, much better by other of his kin, where all the parties could be contented,
than to marie himselfe whome he should happilie neuer loue; and for the possibilitie
of more possessions, leese the fruit and pleasure of this that he had alreadie.
Tor small pleasure taketh a man of all that euer he hath beside, if he be wiued against
his appetite. And I doubt not (quoth he) but there be (as ye say) other, that be in
euerie point comparable with hir. And therefore I let not them that like them to wed
them. No more is it reason, that it mislike anie man, that I marrie where it liketh
me. And I am sure that my cousine of Warwike neither loueth me so little, to
grudge at that I loue; nor is so vnreasonable, to looke that I should in choise of a
wife, rather be ruled by his eie, than by mine owne: as though I were a ward that were
bound to marie by the appointment of a gardian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Libertie preferred before a kingdome.</div>

<p>I would not be a king with that condition, to forbeare mine owne libertie in choise
of mine owne mariage. As for possibilitie of more inheritance by new affinitie in
strange lands, is oft the occasion of more trouble than profit. And we haue alreadie
title by that meanes vnto so much, as sufficeth to get and k&eacute;epe well in one mans daies.
That she is a widow, and hath alreadie children; by Gods blessed ladie, I am a
bacheler, and haue some too, and so ech of vs hath a proofe that neither of vs is like to be
barren. And therefore (madame) I praie you be content, I trust in God she shall bring
foorth a yoong prince that shall please you. And as for the bigamie, let the bishop
hardlie laie it in my waie when I come to take orders. For I vnderstand it is forbidden
a preest, but I neuer wist it yet, that it was forbidden a prince. [This
spake he as alluding to the libertie of princes, whose lust standeth oftentimes for
law, and their opinion for reason, according to the saieng of the poet;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Elizabeth Lucie.</div>

<p>The duches with these words nothing appeased, and s&eacute;eing the king so set thereon,
that she could not pull him backe. So highlie she disdained it, that vnder pretext of
hir dutie to Godward, she deuised to disturbe this mariage, and rather to helpe that
he should marie one dame Elizabeth Lucie, whome the king had also not long before
gotten with child. Wherefore the kings mother openlie obiected against his mariage,
as it were in discharge of hir conscience, that the king was sure to dame Elizabeth
Lucie and hir husband before God. By reason of which words, such obstacle
was made in the matter, that either the bishops durst not, or the king would not
proceed to the solemnization of this wedding, till these same were clearlie purged,
and the truth well and openlie testified. Wherevpon dame Elizabeth Lucie was
then sent for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The kings mariage.</div>

<p>And albeit that she was by the kings mother and manie other put in good comfort,
to affirme that she was ensured vnto the king: yet when she was solemnlie
sworne to saie the truth, she confessed that they were neuer ensured. Howbeit she
said his grace spake so louing words vnto hir, that she verelie hoped he would haue
married hir. And that if it had not b&eacute;ene for such kind words, she would neuer haue
shewed such kindnesse to him, to let him so kindlie get hir with child. This examination
solemnlie taken, when it was cl&eacute;erelie perceiued, that there was none impediment:
the king with great feast and honourable solemnitie married dame Elizabeth
Greie, and hir crowned qu&eacute;ene that was his enimies wife, and manie times had praied
full hartilie for his losse, in which God loued hir better than to grant hir hir boune.</p>

that his ambassage was deluded, that for verie anger and disdaine he (at his returning)
assembled a great puissance against the king, and came so fast vpon him yer he could
be able to resist, that he was faine to void the realme, and flee into Holland for succor,
where he remained for the space of two yeares, leauing his new wife at Westminster
in sanctuarie, where she was deliuered of Edward the prince, of whome we before haue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
spoken. In which meane time the earle of Warwike tooke out of prison, and set vp
againe king Henrie the sixt, who was before by king Edward deposed, and that
much what by the power of the erle of Warwike, which was a wise man, and a
couragious warriour, and of such strength, what for his lands, his aliance, and fauor
with all people, that he made kings and put downe kings almost at his pleasure, and
not impossible to haue atteined it himselfe, if he had not reckoned it a greater
thing to make a king than to be a king.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Warwike slaine.</div>

<p>But nothing lasteth alwaie: far in conclusion, king Edward returned, and with
much lesse number than he had at Barnet on the Easter daie field, slue the earle of
Warwike, with manie other great estates of that partie, &amp; so stablie atteined the
crowne againe, that he peaceablie enioied it vntill his dieng daie: and in such
plight left it, that it could not be lost but by the discord of his verie friends, or
falsehood of his feigned fr&eacute;ends. I haue rehearsed this businesse about this marriage
somewhat the more at length, bicause it might thereby the better appeare, vpon
how slipperie a ground the protector builded his colour, by which he pretended
king Edwards children to be bastards. But that inuention, simple as it was, it liked
them to whome it sufficed to haue somewhat to saie, while they were sure to be
compelled to no larger proofe than themselues list to make.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doc. Shaw's sermon.</div>

<p>Now then (as I began to shew you) it was by the protector and his councell concluded,
that this doctor Shaw should in a sermon at Pauls crosse signifie to the people,
that neither king Edward himselfe, nor the duke of Clarence, were lawfullie
begotten, nor were not the verie children of the duke of Yorke, but gotten vnlawfullie
by other persons, in adulterie, of the duches their mother. And that also dame
Elizabeth Lucie was verilie the wife of king Edward, and so the prince and all his
children bastards, that were begotten vpon the qu&eacute;ene. According to this deuise
doctor Shaw the sundaie after, at Paules crosse in a great audience (as alwaie assembled
great number to his preaching) he tooke for his theame; Spuria vitilamina non
agent radices altas, that is to saie; Bastard slippes shall neuer take d&eacute;epe root.</p>

<p>Therevpon when he had shewed the great grace that God giueth, and secretlie insundeth
in right generation after the lawes of matrimonie, then declared he, that
commonlie those children lacked that grace, and for the punishment of their parents
were (for the more part) vnhappie, which were gotten in base, and speciallie in adulterie.
Of which, though some, by the ignorance of the world and the truth hid
from knowledge, inherited for the season other mens lands, yet God alwaie so prouideth,
that it continueth not in their bloud long: but the truth comming to light,
the rightfull inheritors be restored, and the bastard slip pulled vp yer it can be rooted
d&eacute;epe. And so he did laie for the proofe and confirmation of this sentence certeine
insamples taken out of the old testament, and other ancient histories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This preacher was taught his lesson yer he came into the pulpit.</div>

<div class="sidenote">K. Edward slandered in a sermon.</div>

<p>Then began he to descend into the praise of the lord Richard late duke of
Yorke, calling him father to the lord protector, and declared the title of his heires
vnto the crowne, to whome it was (after the death of king Henrie the sixt) intailed
by authoritie of parlement. Then shewed he that his verie right heire of his bodie
lawfullie begotten was onelie the lord protector. For he declared then, that king
Edward was neuer lawfullie married vnto the qu&eacute;ene, but was before God husband
vnto dame Elizabeth Lucie, and so his children bastards. And besides that, neither
king Edward himselfe, nor the duke of Clarence, among those that were secret in
the houshold, were reckoned verie suerlie for the children of the noble duke, as
those that by their fauours more resembled other knowne men than him. From
whose vertuous conditions he said also that the late king Edward was far off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A maruellous deuise to mooue the assemblie.</div>

<p>But the lord protector he said, the verie noble prince, the speciall paterne of
knightlie prowesse, as well in all princelie behauior, as in the lineaments and fauour
of his visage, represented the verie face of the noble duke his father. This is, quoth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
he, the fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenance, the verie print of his visage,
the sure vndoubted image, the plaine expresse likenesse of that noble duke. Now
was it before deuised, that in the speaking of these words, the protector should
haue comen in among the people to the sermon ward, to the end that those words
m&eacute;eting with his presence, might haue b&eacute;en taken among the hearers, as though the
Holie-ghost had put them in the preachers mouth, &amp; should haue mooued the people
euen there to crie; King Richard, king Richard: that it might haue b&eacute;ene after said,
that he was speciallie chosen by God, and in maner by miracle. But this deuise
quailed, either by the protectors negligence, or the preachers ouermuch diligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard commended by the preacher.</div>

<p>For while the protector found by the waie tarieng least he should preuent those
words, and the doctor fearing that he should come yer his sermon could come to
these words, hasted his matter thereto, he was come to them and past them, and
entered into other matters yer the protector came. Whome when he beheld comming,
he suddenlie left the matter with which he was in hand, and without anie deduction
therevnto, out of all order, and out of all frame, began to repeat those
words againe: "This is the verie noble prince, the speciall patrone of knightlie
prowesse, which as well in all princelie behauior, as in the lineaments &amp; fauor of his
visage, representeth the verie face of the noble duke of Yorke his father: this is the
fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenance, the verie print of his visage, the
sure vndoubted image, the plaine expresse likenesse of the noble duke, whose remembrance
can neuer die while he liueth."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the course of Gods iudgement.</div>

<p>While these words were in speaking, the protector accompanied with the duke of
Buckingham, went through the people into the place where the doctors commonlie
stand in the vpper storie, where he stood to hearken the sermon. But the people
were so farre fr&#333; crieng; K. Richard, that they stood as they had b&eacute;ene turned into
stones, for woonder of this shamefull sermon. After which once ended, the preacher
gat him home, and neuer after durst looke out for shame, but kept him out of sight
like an owle. And when he once asked one that had b&eacute;ene his old friend what the
people talked of him, all were it that his owne conscience well shewed him that
they talked no good; yet when the tother answered him, that there was in euerie
mans mouth spoken of him much shame, it so strake him to the heart, that within
few daies after he withered and consumed awaie [for verie thought and inward pine,
procured by irrecouerable cares, whose nature is noted by obseruation of their effects:</p>

<p>Then on the tuesdaie following this sermon, there came to the Guildhall in London
the duke of Buckingham, accompanied with diuerse lords and knights mo than
happilie knew the message that they brought. And there in the east end of the hall,
where the maior k&eacute;epeth the Hustings, the maior and all the aldermen being assembled
about him, all the commons of the citie gathered before them. After silence
commanded vpon great paine in the protectors name: the duke stood vp, and (as he
was neither vnlearned, and of nature maruellouslie well spoken) he said vnto the
people with a cleare and lowd voice in this maner of wise.</p>


<h2>The duke of Buckingham's oration to the assemblie of the maior, aldermen, and
commoners.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">A notable persuasion.</div>

<p>Friends, for the zeale and heartie fauour that we beare you, we be comen to
breake vnto you of a maner right great and weightie, and no lesse weightie than
pleasing to God, and profitable to all the realme: nor to no part of the realme more
profitable, than to you the citizens of this noble citie. For whie, that thing that
we wote well ye haue long time lacked, and sore longed for, that y&eacute;e would haue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
giuen great good for, that y&eacute;e would haue gone farre to fetch; that thing we be come
hither to bring you without your labour, paine, cost, aduenture or ieopardie. What
thing is that? Certes the suertie of your owne bodies, the quiet of your wiues and
your daughters, the safegard of your goods: of all which things in times past ye stood
euermore in doubt. For who was there of you all, that would reckon himselfe lord
of his own goods among so manie grens &amp; traps as was set therefore, among so much
pilling and polling, among so manie taxes and tallages, of which there was neuer
end, &amp; oftentimes no n&eacute;ed? Or if anie were, it rather grew of riot, and vnreasonable
wast, that anie necessarie or honourable charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burdet.</div>

<p>So that there was dailie pilled fro good men and honest, great substance of goods,
to be lashed out among vnthrifts; so far forth, that fifteenes sufficed not, nor anie
vsual names of knowne taxes: but vnder an easie name of beneuolence and good
will, the commissioners so much of euerie man tooke as no man could with his
good will haue giuen. As though that name of beneuolence had signified, that euerie
man should paie, not what himselfe of his owne good will list to grant, but what
the king of his good will list to take. Which neuer asked little, but euerie thing
was hawsed aboue the measure, amercements turned into fines, fines into ransoms,
small trespasses into misprison, misprison into treason. Whereof (I thinke) no man
looketh that we should remember you of examples by name, as though Burdet were
forgotten, that was for a word spoken in hast cruellie beheaded, by the misconstruing
of the laws of this realme, for the princes pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Markam.</div>

<p>With no lesse honour to Markam then ch&eacute;efe iustice, that left [the benefit &amp;
dignitie] of his office, rather than he would assent to the dishonestie of those, that
either for feare or flatterie gaue that iudgment. What Cooke, your owne worshipful
neighbour, alderman and maior of this noble citie, who is of you so either negligent
that he knoweth not, or so forgetful that he remembreth not, or so hard
hearted that he pittieth not that worshipful mans losse? What speake we of losse? His
vtter spoile and vndeserued destruction, onelie for that it hapned those to fauour him
whome the prince fauoured not. We n&eacute;ed not (I suppose) to rehearse of these anie mo
by name, sith there be (I doubt not) manie h&eacute;ere present, that either in themselues or
in their nigh friends haue knowne, as well their goods as their persons greatlie indangered,
either by feigned quarrels, or small matters aggreeued with heinous names.
And also there was no crime so great, of which there could lacke a pretext.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Open warre not so ill as ciuill.</div>

<p>For sith the king, preuenting the time of this inheritance, atteined the crowne by
battell: it sufficed in a rich man for a pretext of treason, to haue b&eacute;ene of kinred
or aliance, n&eacute;ere familiaritie, or legier acquaintance with any of those that were at
anie time the kings enimies, which was at one time and other more than halfe the
relme. Thus were neither your goods in suertie, and yet they brought your bodies in
ieopardie, beside the common aduenture of open warre, which albeit that it is euer the
will and occasion of much misch&eacute;efe, yet is it neuer so mischeeuous, as where any
people fall at distance among themselues; nor in none earthlie nation so deadlie and so
pestilent, as when it happeneth among vs; and among vs neuer so long continued
dissention, nor so manie batels in that season, nor so cruell and so deadlie fought, as
was in that kings daies that dead is, God forgiue it his soule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ciuill warre the occasion of manie great inconueniencies.</div>

great effusion of the ancient noble bloud of this realme, that scarselie the halfe remaineth,
to the great infeebling of this noble land, beside manie a good towne ransacked
and spoiled by them, that haue b&eacute;ene going to the field or comming from thence.
And peace long after not much surer than war. So that no time was therein, which
rich men for their monie, and great men for their lands, or some other for some feare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>

you. And in that point, which in good faith I am sorie to speake of, sauing that it is in
vaine to k&eacute;epe in counsell that thing that all men know, the kings greedie appetite
was insatiable, and euerie where ouer all the realme intollerable.</p>

of their house, the chastitie of their wiues, and their children, that them were
leauer to leese all that they had beside, than to haue such a villanie doone them. And

the right &amp; title that the most excellent prince Richard duke of Glocester, now protector

the said worshipfull doctor rather signified than fullie explaned, &amp; which things shall
not be spoken for me, as the thing wherein euerie man forbereth to say that he knoweth
in auoiding displeasure of my noble lord protector, bearing (as nature requireth) a
filiall reuerence to the duchesse his mother. For these causes (I say) before remembred
that is to wit, for lacke of other issue lawfullie of the late noble prince Richard duke of
Yorke, to whose roiall bloud the crowne of England and of France is by the high
authoritie of parlement intailed, the right and title of the same is by the iust
course of inheritance (according to the c&#333;mon lawes of the land) deuolued &amp; commen

sonne of the foreremembred noble duke of Yorke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The dignitie and office of a king full of care &amp; studie.</div>

<p>Which thing well considered, and the great knightlie prowesse pondered, with

to the most puissant prince the lord protector, that it maie like his grace (at

to the wealth and increase of the same, according to his verie right and iust title.
Which thing I wote it well, he will be loth to take vpon him, as he whose wisdome
well perceiueth the labor and studie both of mind and bodie, that come therewith,
to whomsoeuer so will occupie the roome, as I dare say h&eacute;e will, if he take it.
Which roome I warne you well is no childs office. And that the great wise man
well perceiued, when h&eacute;e said: V&aelig; regno cuius rex puer est: Wo is that realme that

<p>Wherefore so much the more cause haue we to thanke God, that this noble personage,

and vnto your selues speciall commoditie, to whom his maiestie shall euer after beare
so much the more tender fauor, in how much he shall perceiue you the more prone
and beneuolentlie minded toward his election. Wherein d&eacute;ere friends what mind you
haue, wee require you plainlie to shew vs.</p>

<p>When the duke had said, and looked that the people, whome he hoped that the
maior had framed before should after this proposition made, haue cried; King
Richard, king Richard: all was husht and mute, and not one word answered therevnto.
Wherewith the duke was maruellouslie abashed, and taking the maior neerer
to him, with other that were about him priuie to that matter, said vnto them softlie,
What meaneth this, that the people be so still? Sir (quoth the maior) percase
they perceiue you not well. That shall we mend (quoth he) if that will helpe.
And by &amp; by somewhat lowder he rehearsed to them the same matter againe in other
order, and other words, so well and ornatlie, and nathelesse so euidentlie and plaine,
with voice, gesture and countenance so comelie, and so conuenient, that euerie man
much maruelled that heard him, and thought that they neuer had in their liues heard
so euill a tale so well told [insomuch that he s&eacute;emed as cunning an orator, as he, of
whome the poet spake to his high praise &amp; c&#333;mendation, saieng:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Qu&aelig;libet eloquio causa fit apta suo.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">The election of K. Richard hardlie to be preferred.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Fitz William recorder.</div>

<p>But were it for woonder or feare, or that each looked that other should speake first:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
not one word was there answered of all the people that stood before, but all was as
still as the midnight, not somuch as rowning amongest them, by which they might
s&eacute;eme to commune what was best to do. When the maior saw this, he with other
partners of that councell drew about the duke, and said that the people had not b&eacute;ene
accustomed there to be spoken vnto, but by the recorder, which is the mouth of the
citie, and happilie to him they will answer. With that the recorder, called Fitz
William, a sad man, &amp; an honest, which was so new come into that office, that he
neuer had spoken to the people before, and loth was with that matter to begin, notwithstanding
therevnto commanded by the maior, made rehearsall to the commons of
that the duke had twise rehearsed to them himselfe.</p>

<p>But the recorder so tempered his tale, that he shewed euerie thing as the dukes
words, and no part his owne. But all this noting no change made in the people,
which alwaie after one stood as they had b&eacute;ene men amazed. Wherevpon the duke
rowned vnto the maior and said; This is a maruellous obstinate silence: and therewith
he turned vnto the people againe with these words; D&eacute;ere friends, we come to mooue
you to that thing, which peraduenture we not so greatlie n&eacute;eded but that the lords of
this realme, and the commons of other parties might haue sufficed, sauing that we
such loue beare you, and so much set by you, that we would not gladlie doo without
you, that thing in which to be partners is your weale and honor, which (as it s&eacute;emeth)
either you s&eacute;e not, or weie not. Wherefore we require you giue vs answer one way or
other, whether you be minded, as all the nobles of the realme be, to haue this noble
prince, now protector, to be your king or not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richards election preferred by voices of confederacie.</div>

<p>At these words the people began to whisper among themselues secretly, that the
voice was neither lowd nor distinct, but as it were the sound of a swarme of b&eacute;es, till
at the last in the nether end of the hall, an ambushment of the dukes seruants and
Nashfields, and other belonging to the protector, with, some prentisses and lads that
thrust into the hall amongst the prease, began suddenlie at mens backs to crie out,
as lowd as their throtes would giue; King Richard, king Richard: and threw vp their
caps in token of ioy. And they that stood before, cast backe their heads maruelling
therof, but nothing they said. Now when the duke and the maior saw this maner,
they wiselie turned it to their purpose, and said it was a goodlie crie, &amp; a ioifull, to
heare euerie man with one voice, no man saieng naie.</p>

<p>Wherefore friends (quoth the duke) sith we perceiue it is all your whole mind to
haue this noble man for your king (whereof we shall make his grace so effectuall
report, that we doubt not but it shall redound vnto your great weale and commoditie)
we require ye, that ye to morrow go with vs, and we with you vnto his noble grace, to
make our humble request vnto him in maner before remembred. And therewith the
lords came downe, and the companie dissolued and departed, the more part all sad:
some with glad semblance that were not verie merrie, and some of those that came
thither with the duke not able to dissemble their sorrow, were faine at his backe to
turne their face to the wall while the dolor of their hearts burst out of their eies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The maiors comming to Bainards castell vnto the lord protector.</div>

<p>Then on the morrow after, the maior with all the aldermen, and chiefe commoners
of the citie, in their best maner apparelled, assembling themselues togither,
resorted vnto Bainards castell, where the protector laie. To which place repaired
also (according to their appointment) the duke of Buckingham, and diuerse noble
men with him, beside manie knights and other gentlemen. And therevpon the
duke sent word vnto the lord protector, of the being there of a great and honourable
companie, to mooue a great matter vnto his grace. Wherevpon the protector
made difficultie to come out vnto them, but if he first knew some part of their
errand, as though he doubted and partlie mistrusted the comming of such a number
vnto him so suddenlie, without anie warning or knowledge, whether they came for
good or harme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the duke, when he had shewed this to the maior and other, that they might
thereby s&eacute;e how little the protector looked for this matter, they sent vnto him by the
messenger such louing message againe, and therewith so humblie besought him, to
vouchsafe that they might resort to his presence to propose their intent, of which
they would vnto none other person anie part disclose; that at the last he came foorth
of his chamber, and yet not downe vnto them, but stood aboue in a gallerie ouer
them, where they might s&eacute;e him, and speake to him, as though he would not yet
come too n&eacute;ere them till he wist what they ment. And therevpon the duke of Buckingham
first made humble petition vnto him on the behalfe of them all, that his grace
would pardon them, and licence them to propose vnto his grace the intent of their
comming, without his displeasure, without which pardon obteined, they durst not be
bold to mooue him of that matter.</p>

<p>In which albeit they ment as much honor to his grace, as wealth to all the realme
beside, yet were they not sure how his grace would take it, whome they would in no
wise offend. Then the protector (as he was verie gentle of himselfe, and also longed
sore to wit what they ment) gaue him leaue to propose what him liked, verelie trusting
(for the good mind that he bare them all) none of them anie thing would intend vnto
himward, wherewith he ought to b&eacute;e gr&eacute;eued. When the duke had this leaue and
pardon to speake, then waxed he bold to shew him their intent and purpose, with all
the causes moouing them therevnto (as ye before haue heard) and finallie to bes&eacute;ech
his grace, that it would like him, of his accustomed goodnesse and zeale vnto the
realme, now with his eie of pitie to behold the long continued distresse and decaie of
the same, and to set his gratious hands to redresse and amendment thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">O singular dissimulation of king Richard.</div>

<p>All which he might well doo, by taking vpon him the crowne and gouernance of
this realme, according to his right and title lawfullie descended vnto him, and to the
laud of God, profit of the land, &amp; vnto his noble grace so much the more honour, and
lesse paine, in that, that neuer prince reigned vpon anie people, that were so glad to
liue vnder his obeisance, as the people of this realme vnder his. When the protector
had heard the proposition, he looked verie strangelie thereat, and answered: that all
were it that he partlie knew the things by them alledged to be true, yet such entire
loue he bare vnto king Edward and his children, that so much more regarded his
honour in other realmes about, than the crowne of anie one of which he was neuer
desirous, that he could not find in his hart in this point to incline to their desire. For
in all other nations, where the truth were not well knowne, it should peraduenture be
thought, that it were his owne ambitious mind and deuise, to depose the prince, and
take himselfe the crowne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">K. Richard spake otherwise than he meant.</div>

<p>With which infamie he would not haue his honour stained for anie crowne, in which
he had euer perceiued much more labour and paine, than pleasure to him that so
would vse it, as he that would not, were not worthie to haue it. Notwithstanding,
he not onlie pardoned them the motion that they made him, but also thanked them
for the loue and hartie fauour they bare him, praieng them for his sake to giue and
beare the same to the prince, vnder whom he was, and would be content to liue, and
with his labour and counsell (as farre as should like the king to vse him) he would doo
his vttermost deuoir to set the realme in good state, which was alreadie in this little
while of his protectorship (the praise giuen to God) well begun, in that the malice
of such as were before occasion of the contrarie, and of new intended to be, were
now partlie by good policie, &amp; partlie more by Gods speciall prouidence, than mans
prouision, repressed.</p>

<p>Vpon this answer giuen, the duke by the protectors licence, a little rowned aswell
with other noble men about him, as with the maior and recorder of London. And
after that (vpon like pardon desired &amp; obteined) he shewed alowd vnto the protector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
that for a finall conclusion, that the realme was appointed K. Edwards line should not
anie longer reigne vpon them, both for that they had so farre gone, that it was now no
suertie to retreat, as for that they thought it for the weale vniuersall to take that waie,
although they had not yet begun it. Wherefore, if it would like his grace to take the
crowne vpon him, they would humblie bes&eacute;ech him therevnto. If he would giue them
a resolute answer to the contrarie, which they would be loth to heare, then must they
n&eacute;eds s&eacute;eke and should not faile to find some other noble man that would. These
words much mooued the protector, which else (as euerie man may w&eacute;et) would neuer
of likelihood haue inclined therevnto.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The protector taketh vpon him to be king.</div>

<p>But when he saw there was none other waie, but that either he must take it, or
else he and his both go from it, he said vnto the lords and commons; Sith we perceiue
well that all the realme is so set, whereof we be verie sorie, that they will not suffer
in any wise king Edwards line to gouerne them, whom no man earthlie can gouerne
against their willes; &amp; we well also perceiue, that no man is there, to whome the
crowne can by iust title apperteine, as to our selues, as verie right heire lawfully begotten
of the bodie of our most d&eacute;ere father Richard late duke of Yorke, to which
title is now ioined your election, the nobles and commons of this realme, which we of
all titles possible take for the most effectuall: we be content and agr&eacute;e fauourablie to
incline to your petition and request, and (according to the same) here we take vpon vs
the roiall estate, preheminence and kingdome of the two noble realmes, England and
France: the one from this daie forward by vs and our heires to rule, gouerne, and defend;
the other by Gods grace, and your good helpe, to get againe and subdue, and
establish for euer in due obedience vnto this realme of England, the aduancement
wherof we neuer aske of God longer to liue than we intend to procure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A made match to cousen the people.</div>

<p>With this there was a great shout, crieng; King Richard, king Richard. And then
the lords went vp to the king (for so was he from that time called) and the people departed,
talking diuerslie of the matter, euerie man as his fantasie gaue him. But
much they talked and maruelled of the maner of this dealing, that the matter was on
both parts made so strange, as though neither had euer communed with other thereof
before, when that themselues wist there was no man so dull that heard them, but he
perceiued well inough that all the matter was made betw&eacute;ene them. Howbeit some
excused that againe, and said all must be doone in good order though: and men must
sometime for the maners sake, not be aknowen what they know [though it be hard to
outreach the circumspect, wise, &amp; vigilant minded man; as the poet saith:</p>

<p>For at the consecration of a bishop, euerie man woteth well by the paieng for his
buls, that he purposeth to be one, &amp; though he paie for nothing else. And yet must
he be twise asked whether he will be bishop or no, and he must twise saie naie, and
the third time take it, as compelled therevnto by his owne will. And in a stage plaie,
all the people know right well, that one plaieng the Soldan, is percase a sowter; yet
if one should can so little good, to shew out of season what acquaintance he hath with
him, and cast him by his owne name while he standeth in his maiestie, one of his tormentors
might hap to breake his head (and worthie) for marring of the plaie. And so
they said, that these matters be kings games, as it were stage plaies, and for the more
part plaied vpon scaffolds, in which poore men be but the lookers on. And they that
wise be will meddle no further. For they that sometime step vp, and plaie with them,
when they can not plaie their parts, they disorder the plaie, and doo themselues no
good.</p>
